Easy peasy
Let's have Virginia play it
Yes
I don't like how the symbol says CP
Change it Kona
undefined
Prefect
Perfect
It's not looking good for me sadly
Awww
when are guys heading to the cabin?
Thursday night
Probably leaving at 7 so we don't get the worst of the traffic
ah
I'm gonna go to class on friday and head out a little after noon I think
Ok
Virginia if you bring your ps4 we could dark souls together
Or drunk souls
Hehe. Okey
Mario party
Kona is bringing that right?
I hope so
I'm gonna school your asses
You get a handicap
That's unfair yo
On the contrary
I'll take the handicap then
I'll still school your asses.
Bring it
Willing to make a bet?
I'll bet kona's virginity
Whoever wins gets to take Kona
Kk agreed
Kona must win to keep his virginity for someone else
Huh
What
Virginia you in on this?
Why don't I get to choose
you get to choose if you win
The dark souls gods have choosen
this is mario party tho
My choice is no fucc
Doesnt matter, praise the sun
I'm more of a gwyndolin myself
praise the moon
Personally I praise RNJesus
Mario party is more than RNJ
RNG
is there anything in particular i should bring this weekend?
Mario party
Maybe a swimsuit
Rainjacket, hiking stuff
Board games
you guys will need to bring some controllers
i dont have enough
I have ps3/ps4 controllers
I have plenty
Ok bring two
PS4 preferred
I'm probably gonna bring my PS4
and have virginia bring hers so we can Dark Souls/Bloodborne a bit
We need to play jackbox
Yes
I was gonna bring my PS4 to make Alex play PT
Pt?
PS4 party
Spooky game
Why did I set my uncle as the group photo
why do you do any of the strange things you do

Skylar are you awake
yes
though I shouldn't be
but I get to sleep in a bit
We just broke down 20 min from the cabin
oh shit
this is gonna suck, but I guess I'm coming
We're going to get towed to skamania
I'm gonna get some stuff packed
Also we need a ps4 power cable
weekend is starting early
yep
alright its gonna take me about an hour to get there
plus some cause I gotta pack
We'll prob be in town by the time you get here
most likely
You won't have service when you get here
Alright
Leaving now
Prob just meet in skamania at chappell's towing
Sounds good
Is that what you sent me here?
This place?
That's where we are rn
Mile marker 26 on hwy 14 going east.
Ok heading there
Still waiting.
I hope you brought snacks
All we have is weed cookies
Ate chips
Just got on 14
Be careful
undefined
undefined
So we're gonna get Zieren here
what about me?
you too dummy
cabin has room for 8 to sleep comfortably
this won't happen for a while if it does at all
if we do it again it'll be more than a weekend.
Ofc it's gonna happen
I'm gonna room with Z :3
I wanna room with z though :(
we'll have multiple nights
we can swap
Ok
that way we also get Kona :3
Sweet :3
I mean if you wanted to get snuggly, bunk bed room could hold 4
but that might be too much
Hiya
What
XD
Hey zieren
We need to tell ghost stories next time
can we go out into the woods and make a fire anywhere?
or is that illegal there
on that property and such
Like how they used to make the kids sleep under the cabin until one disappeared in the middle of the night
I don't think we can have fires outside
Just in the indoor one
well we can turn off the lights inside for spooky stories
I'll tell the story of the raccoon who died from lack of attention
Sounds dreadful
I'm getting pcd from last weekend zzz
Pcd?
post cabin depression
I'm getting pcp
Post cabin panic
Cause homework
Well gee skylar why didn't you do your hw on friday?
Dev what are you up to these days?
getting this photo business off the ground, flying, doing 18 credits at school, working part-time :/
You doing grad school?
nope :/
More aviation schooling then
Yup
How many more years you got?
just this semester
Oh that's not so bad then
Nope
Normal Fieri
kill it
How dare you make me see this with my own two eyes
We should go to the Ape Caves whenever we go back to the cabin :O
Yesss
aaaaaaaaa
cute :3
Are you my mummy?
This Capra demon is causing immense sorrow
get up on those stairs :O
Yea I beat him once I got past the first 10s
The depths sound like a nice place
the depths aren't too bad
I wonder if there's cookies and milk within
kinda confusing to navigate
Can't be any harder than navigating firelink
did you go to the skellies?
I found them way early on and found pretty quick I couldn't fight them
When am u supposed to go back
wait until you get the lordvessel
otherwise you'll just hit a brick wall after the first boss
Oh god its pudge
No fresh meat for him
What
Where the hell are you? xD
Oh god its happening
I'm beginning to dream of dark souls
how far are you?
Same as tursday, the depths
party with the rats :O
I prob won't be able to play it again until sat
word of advice, if you find the large titanite shard and the large ember, go back to the blacksmith and upgrade a weapon to +6
then if you have the weapon smith box
Yea
you can upgrade it to +10 in blighttown
I tried making my spear divine but it sucked so I reverted it back to +5
Rip green shard
divine is only good for skellies
Any of you grabbing civ 6 friday?
I know kona is
I would if it wouldn't blow up my laptop
I love civ v
Definitely
You could always turn down the gfx
Never played a civ game myself
but I don't have the time to get invested
so I probably won't :P
Shame, civ 5 was great
My history major friend never stopped talking about it
so I assume it was good
Brody?
yup
playing it with his tiny hands :O
I was gonna say, how did he hold the mouse with those hands
here come the memes
give us all the juicy memes Kona
Where do you fall on the gender spectrum
holy fuck
Are you a bad hombre or a nasty woman Skylar
nasty hombre
right in the middle of the spectrum
Virgina, it's happening
Warriors movie
prepare for cat battles
Kona's memes are
I'd watch it
Virginia needs to get online so I can see her get hype
Omg there is a new person in this chat and I spammed it with dick pics
Also wtf a Warriors movie? It better be good holy shit.
What did you dream
He killed us all and took our souls
I was fighting a spoopy boss
Spoop. :3c
Do I want a raw spear or a spear+6
first off
what build are you going for?
spears actually aren't great with any stat actually
I dunno
hmm
A simple build for a simple warrior
raw will be the strongest
and you could go back and find a better weapon later
What about +7
Wouldn't that be better than raw
I made it +6
that gives you the most options yeah
raw is ok
not what I usually do but I really pick out my stats
like from the start
I know what I'm gonna do
I gotta uncurse myself D:
I have never been cursed in dark souls actually
Yup
Don't get cursed
Though if you are cursed you can fight ghosts
But there are items that temporarily allow you to fight ghosts
And keep your health
So next cabin trip
When can you fly out here kyle
Dev can always fly standby
And the rest of us can drive
How is the 17th if Dec for everyone
That weekend I mean
that will work for me
i'll be on the east coast
Probably fine for me
Just that weekend?
I have to check if my finals are done by then
i might be in dubai >.>
Ok maybe a different weekend then
And kyle I have to use vacation for every weekday it extends to
Me too
I wouldn't mind taking a thurs/friday off though
I'd go 3 days off max I think
I mean I can move that around so I can make a weekend work
Ok what about you kona
Also if anyone wants to bring more people feel free, we can fit up to about 10 people
i'll be on the east coast
I'm assuming he's leaving as soon as the quarter ends?
Have you bought the plane ticket yet kona?
Skylar/dev I've got the the perfect halloween costume for you two
oh no
Little red riding hood and the big bad wolf
ok I can get behind this actually
Haha
Let's do it
If I want going to be somewhere, I'd fly to Portland
cabin is only like an hour away from Portland
Can pick us up some voodoo on your way over
I could yeah. Get a whole box
No
Any chance you could change the date you went back?
No
When are you going to be around then
Gotta find a date we can all make
So I talked with the creator of the Jimmy Neutron sticker pack for the last 2 hours
Our wisconsin-based hq wired a radio into our speaker system last week and it's been playing country all day today
Oh no
May as well die
Hey Virigina
do you think Alex's tractor is sexy?~
What
No
Get it away
Omg cute
Are those got dogs?
I believe so
so can we make Cabin party 2 happen this winter? It's gonna be cold af
but that's what cuddles are for
Or we could snowboard
In the mountains
Hot tub party
that's even colder!
hot tub sounds nice
I'll live there
Snowboarding needs to happen regardless of the cabin
Dec 17th weekend is the only weekend in Dec that works for me. The 3rd would too but I think that's mff for you guys
and right before finals for me
Kona says he can't make that though
when is UW spring break?
I dunno why he won't just schedule his flight back for after that
probably his dad
Tbh I feel like someone won't be able to make it for any date we choose
Well I'm not rescheduling stuff to please his dad
So kona can either stand up for himself or not go
let's get Zieren at least
Yea can you make the 17th of Dec zieren?
That's right during finals for me, I'm not sure
Probably not :(
your finals are that late?
Yea damn
Yep
Dec 16 til dec 22
They always start on a friday for some reason at njit
that's dumb
We could try for a january/february date
It's not like winter ends on december 31st
my quarter starts right after new years
Isn't there a holiday in jan?
oh MLK Jr day
jan 16 on a monday
We could do that weekend
I'd be ok with that
and Zieren you won't even have classes then right?
My classes start january 17
But, i could get a flight out on the 16th, and i should be good
yeah we'd be heading home that day too
Am i the only one coming from far away?
That's so weird ><
Dev is from kinda far away
also we can try to snag others :P
I'm not that far ;;
yeah huh
you're far out
Happy birthday kona!
woo Kona!
So can we all make mlk weekend for the cabin?
I'll prob drive up thurs evening again and take Fri off
I can do that
So there's a furry bowling meet in 2 weeks and I know some friends who are going up there from Salem
Anybody interested in going?
Lily wants to join
Possibly
furries make me uncomfortable
Probably not. Idr like bowling.
I'd def party with people tho if that happens
Bowling is fun
My Salem friends are cooooool
I had a great time with them this weekend
theres one that goes to the arcade that hits on me
Ew
Hey happy birthday you
thanks :D
Recipe for rallex
I thought you meant
Basically that's just a pizza
Like I'm as good as a pizza. We're equivalent
So does mlk weekend work for everyone?
I need to schedule with the cabin owner
Mozr
Mostly asking mitch/kyle
Yah I think that's great if they can commit
I'm assuming kona can make that weekend
What weekend
Weekend of the 14th
January
I think that's fc weekend D:
What days? My classes start that Monday
On mlk day?
You don't need to be at syllabus day anyway
Oh wait you're right, they start Tuesday
Phew
Were we thinking Fri through mon?
Yea
We'd drive down thurs evening again
And then I'll save you again
I got a couple of friends from Salem who might be interested in joining us
The guys we met at Furlandia
Ragscoon and his bf Chim
Who?
These two
Huh don't remember them
Yah they're on board if that's ok
It is starting to get full
That would be 8 people with Dev and Zieren too
Who would I sleep with
Dev
He straight tho
lol
Omg
Gd that's cute
So weekend of the 14th?
Dev you said that's fc weekend but can anyone do a different weekend?
What about the weekend of the 7th
Is that before school starts for everyone?
Pretty sure class would have started for me but it'd only be the first week so I wouldn't care
I have class too but eh
I'll survive
Mitch/kyle what about you two
Might work, I'll let you know
I won't have school though that's for sure
Alright, preferably soon as I need to schedule the time with the owner
Jan 7th would work
Oh, the cabin is closed until April
well then
Rip
summer?
Well we can still all hang out
true
Doesn't have to be at the cabin
We should all get a hotel in portland
that Hilton we stayed at last time was great
Esp. with mitch's discounts
yussssss
Kona/kitty what does this say
Must be the dj
Gd I can't believe I didn't see that lol
Lol
It's the dj's fault for choosing that atrocious font
ahahaha
I'll forgive him though, he has some kickin tunes
So we should so that Portland trip
Do
Dev you gotta book that hotel
We should choose a good date range
Too deep into the quarter is bad
Jan 7th weekend seemed to work for everyone
what should i do today
Nut
Go to the thanksgiving thing
it rainin' tho
so
You should be used to it by now
so
Do you have an umbrella
i'm no tourist
skylar quick drive up and karaoke with us
no can do
I'm too young lmao
Whatcha guys doing after?
My place
I may come over if that's ok
Of course
We will probably be back at 1030
You have to be 21 for karaoke? Don't they just give you a wristband if you're underage?
No
You can't even enter the building lmao
It's a bar with karaoke rooms. You have to be 21 to get in
I It's the place we went to skylar
Are you guys home
I am but I'm upstairs. I think alex is passed out. I haven't seen him in like 3 hours?
Tonight prob isn't a good night to come over tbh
We got super messed up
ok
yongy
Do you know yongy
Yes
He was kinda creepy
At one of Virginia's parties
And shortly after I got kinda scarred from a nightmare about getting raped at a party
I knooooooow
He's just kinda awkwardly bi
That's my fetish
How do I make this a telegram gif
Kitty you're dating this guy?
Wtf
undefined
Lol
I haven't reached ipa circle jerk where I gotta have the hoppiest most disgusting shit
That's a lie
what's a lie?
I haven't reached that level
I am being honest
Alex has reached that level
You haven't
yeah he quoted me
I was making fun of him :P
Heh
Getting greedy
So Portland
We should all spend a weekend there
Agreed
Dev if you can make it you should reserve the hotel but if not I need to know so I can reserve it
Yes
Ummm I'll have see when I can do it....this is like a really bad time for me
Anything in the next few months
Weekend of Jan 7th seemed to work best for people. Can you make that
Maybe
I'm going to just book a hotel for that weekend
Dev you should come if you can
It's been too long since I've had voodoo
I'm trying!
Sorry I can't confirm though x.x
I know, I just want to make sure it happens for the rest of us
I asked Lazor knowing full well that he probably won't. He's still young and just going to Portland with strangers is probably a bit odd
Who?
Lazorcat?
yeah
Don't know him
he lives near Olympia
I'll probably hang out with him sometime myself
we've been talking and I'd consider us friends
He might feel more inclined to come if you do that before the trip
yeah I'm thinking Furlandia
would be better
Ok
I am back in Seattle
Where did you go
Mff
Oh right
Who?
That's chuck e cheese
undefined
ill work every weekend in december and i should be good to go as well as FC the next weekend
There is no X in Portland
PDX portland......same difference
I know
Why the X tho
airport
I know
I want to know why it has a FUCKING X
IDK
You're the pilot
someone wanted to use an X in the airport code
its all honestly like......different
LAX
idk sorry ;-;
google it
It's to remind the airport goers who is gonna give it to ya
X means international
All international airports have it
den, sea, jfk, msp, atl, ord, dfw
hardly
PIT
BOS
That's what I'd heard. Maybe if it has an x it's int but not all int have an x? Dunno
has to do with the early days of airport and weather stations
Ooooo
they added an x to the end of the two letter identifier
happened at lax and phx too
this may be right or not
Phoenix has an X tho
Yup
it was added in after the 3 letter id was adopted
OK so you going to reserve the hotel then @Devleon
what hotel
like if i have to pay now there is nooo way i can
Usually you dont
I just figure you should since you get discounts
downtown again?
what dates again
are we doing furlandia again
I'm def down
And Jan 7th weekend dev
Fri/sat nights
Hilton again?
also the price is the same atm cause of a deal
whats the price
Total?
Damn
per night
idk if ill be able to get in on friday and id hate to have my name in a hotel i cant get to
OK I can reserve it tomorrow then
nononononono
side bar on the left, packages and promos
click that
Which promo/package
Sale
Ohh
So is the hotel booked?
Oh uh not yet
I'll book it this weekend
I think that promo ended ;_;
Zzz
How much more is it?
Actually you could always put our names on the reservation
If you book it
idk
i just got back from driving through death
I'm about to book the Hilton for Jan 6-8
Two nights
The one at 921 sw 6th ave
What are we even planning on doing in Portland
Everything
It's 134/night
Please be more specific
portlandy things
Wander around town, play board games, eat donuts
Maybe shopping
Definitely food carts
Rags is gonna hang with us too
just a day trip for him
Oh nice
It'll be $44 total/person
So cheap
I don't think he's staying in the hotel
Oh ok
him and his bf would be hanging out with us
Then it's like 55/person
Still cheap
that ain't bad
Skylar I'm adding you as the additional guest in the reservation
Also you should add rags and his bf to this chat
alrighty
undefined
Rags is gay
OK so after taxes and everything it's $61/person
Awesome
That's super affordable
Oh hi
Rags I don't have Chim as a contact
feel free to add him to the group
Wooow
undefined
whoa hi, what did I get added to
A weekend of shenanigans
oh boy
This is that thing these guys are doing in Portland in January
yeah Jan 6-8
oh I see
these fools are gonna be driving down to Portland and staying in a hotel for the weekend
well except for Zieren. This was originally a group for another plan
which still might happen this summer
Oh the cabin thing?
Is zieren coming to furlandia?
never thought about that
hell
that'd be cool
We were going to go to the cabin but it's closed during the winter apparently
ok so what exactly is the plan? you guys are getting a room in Portland and just hanging out for the weekend? Or are there particular places you'd like to go?
I imagine bars/dives are off the menu of places you can go
yeah Kona is underage
I mean we can always kinda split off a bit
lots of people after all
I remember, but it's not a big deal, there's only a couple bars I know of in Portland anyway really
Since I'm usually the driver I don't do much drinking on Portland trips
We can always go to the barcade
oh yeah, would have to be earlier in the day too, before their minor cut off time
also before the dudebro crowd shows up
I feel like such a shit locking you guys out of half the city :<
oh my god kona don't
bars aren't that amazing
sometimes you go into a gay bar and then you hear talk of cheesy assholes
and you don't want to go to ground kontrol after like 5 PM anyway, it gets packed with frat bros and their girls
Not in my experience
every time I've been to ground kontrol after 5 there's been a line, a bouncer, and frat bros shouting OOOOOOOO and chugging canned beer
the same thing kinda happens with Coin Jam here in Salem, we have a smaller barcade here
and then when Eugene opened one up while I was living there for school
i llike round 1
I'd really like to see Round 1, I missed my chance when I was in Seattle last time
I hear it's pretty bomb
I've been listening to porter Robinson all day
That show was so good
Let's get lazor to join us at round 1
when tho
today
Sometime next month maybe
When's furlandia?
Memorial day weekend
I think
I was right
May 27-29, 2016
Yep
I'll still have classes sadly
But I'm gonna go
And if you guys plan a Seattle thing too let me and Chim know, we might be up for that
Haven't been out there since RF '14
Long time
It's a 4-5 hour drive for us so we gotta have a good reason to make the journey
yeah totally
what about the weekend after the portland trip
mlk jr day means 3 day weekend :P
although I'm not sure how the lodging situation is now. I'd be willing split on a hotel with you and Chim though
That'd be cool, plenty of time to putz around and Chim's on board with it
Double weekend fun :D
I'm always here
I'm assuming most people here are around or at least closer to Seattle, so I guess Chim and me would be the bigger decision on that one
yeah the rest of them live in the area
kind of a big decision on my part too
missing two weekends in the first few weekends of school
I could fall behind
I'll just not have a social life for the weekdays
Lily might be on board for pdx trip
Right, my bad haha, if you're up for it then we are
Well I suggested it :P
But it's only if you guys wanna do it too
Of course, we're game
We doing karaoke saturday
In portland
I have coupons
How do you use them
Do I need them when I reserve?
I don't think
It's just a gift card
It's hard being not gay with the fam around :<
Just do what I do too not come off gay
Use a deep voice, keep your shoulders broad, and don't ever stick your butt out
I mean, I think that worked when I was in Texas, nobody said anything so
The butt part is hard :<
Wait why were you in texas
Was meeting Chim for the first time, he lived on the Texas Louisiana border
Then we took a road trip from there to Colorado for rmfc
Oh fun
I almost had my straight disguise down but
I couldn't get away from the gay outfits
Were you discovered? :o
I need gay outfits tbh
We stopped at a gas station and it was my turn to pay for gas, was going into the convenience store and held the door for these three little kids, one of them walked by and was like "coughgaycough"
Ask your mom for her old jeans
I don't wear jeans really :<
Oh
I've got a surplus of skinny jeans, really need some variety...
All of the jeans I wear are skinny jeans
All 1 pairs
Did you say to them  "you're not my type"? :V
No, they were like 10, I didn't want to get lynched
Oh, lol
Are leggings gay
Yes
They feel fantastic
I love them
The real question is shorts on top or no shorts on top
Shorts clash but hide the dick
Skirt
Skirt
Shorts can work with leggings dude, you just need the right pair
Color coordinate it
You have to find those tight kinds of shorts with the legs rolled up a little
Yeah, that's what I use
I'll take older skinny jeans I have and cut the legs off to turn them into shorts, roll them up a little to hide the fray
And if you have fabric glue to keep it rolled up then perfect
I should get a skirt
yeah! :3
just be careful about the tighter business looking skirts, on guys they make the bulge much more apparent lol
We should go shopping in Portland tbh
Absolutely, Portland has some cool stores
I need gay shit
Like
I wanna be gayer in general tbh
It's a problem
I do most of my shopping on Amazon, can be hit or miss
Yeah
Sparkles prob knows of some good clothing shops around Portland, I'm asking him if he wants to come
He's the one with the pink mohawk
I don't remember what anyone from Portland looks like. :<
Lemme see a photo
He's the middle
Only pic I could find that didn't have something over his face
I remember the ear things
The gauges
He looks like an entire ska-punk band in one person
In a good way though
When you meet him you'll continue to think so
It's the spirit of Portland really
I'm hype for this trip
Speaking of which I need to call the karaoke place
I wanna be really gay during it
During this trip home all the gay is being stuck inside
A friend and I just did an awesome escape room thing. Same store is in the vancouver mall. Anybody interested in doing a team based puzzle escape adventure during our portland trip? :D
I'd be down
Gonna do another one tomorrow. One I did here was a 20 minute challenge. We beat it with not hints with 3 and a half minutes remaining. The ones in Vancouver are an hour long
Wrong chat rags ><
huh
yeah I think Chim aand I might be up to it, I'll ask him
this?
I was talking about PAX
well
what is this thing that I'm up to
no good
uhoh
uh, I guess PAX is in Seattle, it's a gaming con, which is one thing Iwas gonna ask you about
the other was that puzzle room thing I told you about during dinner
PAX is the best
i work there lmao
Portland - Jan 6-8
Seattle - 13 - 16
Furlandia - May 27 - 29
PAX West - August ???
oh and Cabin trip
these are fun events we have talked about :P
PAX's 2017 date is not public
hence the ???
I'm up for anything
yeah, for the Portland thing, my crew lives just like 40 minutes from Portland, so we're along for the ride, we're down for what the rest of you want to do
and we can show off some neat places we know of if warranted
yeah Portland I think you guys should come up for Saturday at the very least
that's the plan, maybe Sunday too if there's more going on? but we're not staying the night
escape room game is $120 total so the more the merrier
how many people can be in one room?
escape room I mean
Oooh okay
It says 4-8 recommended
That's the trick to escape rooms:
You have to smuggle a ninth person in via backpack
Me!
undefined
Lazor is prob gonna join us in Seattle the weekend after Portland
Woah I'm in a new group
WELCOME TO THIS DOMAIN, SPEAK YOUR NAME AND WHAT YOU WILL
Hi, I'm Lazorcat and I just want love.
well i wont hurt you ;p
I like the group icon
He might nibble a bit though
Lazor is my son and I will protect him from you heathens
id like to see you try
I will shield him with my body
Ill just pick you up and move you out of the way
I hope you're ready to see a grown man flail and cry
Ill just hold you out.....not like you'd be able to hit me lol
I can spit
I can toss
Dang
Well I'll still protect lazor
Somehow
Lazor, do you accept me
Dev is tall and cannot be trusted
im the BFG
You'll need to fill out this 30 page psychological evaluation alongside a cursory physical exam before I make my decision
Big friendly gay
basically
Does lazor need a room? He can crash with us if need be
Unless he also lives near Seattle, which I think is the case
It's a hour drive to Seattle but there's no way I would be able to stay overnight on this trip
That's the reason I can't make the Portland trip
Aah alright then
Either way it'll be awesome to meet, hope to see you there
yeah Lazor is a youngun, it's understandable that he should have some limits
I mean the youngest guy in the room besides him would be me and I'm a whole 6 years older
Also, Lazor, everyone here is in the northwest except Zieren. I just love Zieren so I wanna find an excuse to get him to hang out with us. Perhaps PAX
perhaps cabin trip
so much to do!
so much to see!
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
I'm not dead lmao
You'll never shine if you don't glow
I assumed you weren't going to stay in the room with Rags, Chim, and I in Seattle
Oh probably not
yeah I assumed Seattle peeps would wanna save their money
I'll stay in already paid for land
My goal is to be able to stay in a room with people for Furlandia, hopefully that will happen if I meet up with you guys in "safer" circumstances enough times.
yep, we'll see how things go
When are you going to seattle?
the weekend right after :P
Two weekends of this chat. :D
fc is the next weekend though D:
yeah and I can't go to that
So do we fly out sunday?
for the pdx weekend?
yeah
though it's just gonna be you flying this time I think
hmmm ok
We're gonna have Zieren some time over the summer I'm hoping
Furlandia  maybe?
maybe
They run all day
There's like 5 places
Just gotta book it in advance
Ok
there are so many escape rooms @_@
I've looked in the past but never found any. I must be bad at google
Locurio - $35
The Vanishing Act
Puzzle Break - $30
Escape From Twenty Thousand Leagues
Escape the Midnight Carnival
Ninja Escape - $28
Defeat the Kraken (Mission 1: Hack Attack)
Defeat the Kraken (Mission 2: Black Lace)
Defeat the Kraken (Mission 3: Enter the Machine)
Ninjas Vs. Zombies (Trapped in a room with a Zombie)
Ninjas Vs. Zombies (Still Hungry)
these 3 locations get recommended a lot based on my google skills
So it's ~30 per person?
what weekend?
I think I love puzzle break because that name is hilariously generic
approximately
Locurio wouldn't hire my ass
lol
Locurio sounds like they've got one amazing room
and then not much else
they have an outdoor puzzle but that sounds hella confusing
and cold
They have a room but as part of the hiring process I already know all the answers
oh
well then not doing that
There's a groupon for Ninja Escape mission 1
we'd be saving money if more than 7 went
more than 6 I mean
is this for the portland trip or seattle?
seattle
If I'm not staying in Seattle with you guys you gotta send me an itinerary with what you're planning so I know when I gotta drive up.
portland we pretty much just drinking and eating gay donuts?
ah shit somebody is missing out if I only do one!
you know I'm gonna deep throat a dick donut
shit might have to just do one in portland too
I want Dev in on this
i have an extremely busy next week
chilling would be more than cool with me
alright
that solves that
who's in for the escape room in Seattle? 7 in this chat will be there
traveling to san fran after pdx
The country must feel very small to you Dev
seattle to jfk is still 6hrs x.x
but yeah kinda
It's 7 for SEA-PIT
I hate it
I won't like spending money on both Round 1 and an escape room but I guess I'll do it if I can be there
It's gonna be an expensive few weeks for me
I can't wait to hear dev sing at karaoke
We should have a game day. Meet up at Round 1 and hang out there before heading to an escape room
maybe come back for bowling
Sat or sun?
I'll probably just come up for that day then.
I'm up for either. any other Seattle plans?
Snowboarding for me
But I can do that either day
It's better to do R1 later
Goddamnit Skylar
Count us in, we barely know the Seattle area lol
You don't have to come to those :P
No you just never spell it right lmao
oh right
I always forget
Pike Place is the road it's on
Therefore the noun is not possessive
Now I'll just say it to piss you off
It's the new pep
I don't know why it pisses me off so easily but it does lmao
can't wait to buy some pep at Pike's
Let's have a Olympia weekend instead, we can do fun stuff like... Give money to homeless people... And... Go to tiny art exhibits.
I'm excited for round 1
I'm excited to have today off
Holiday pay ftw
No other arcades have good rhythm games, I'm really looking forward to that.
Have you been to r1 lazor?
Nope, haven't heard of it before Rallex suggested it.
It's pretty awesome tbh
so we gotta play the table flip game
that's mandatory
Ofc
I should go there more, it's like a five min drive from my work
Nope nope nope
I can't sing and you don't want to hear it
get him drunk
I won't even drunk
I'll get drunk enough for the both of us
That's not hard for you to do
shush
split his fill with me so we're not having to carry you everywhere :P
sounds good
Happy kwanza
The smash mouth twitter is good today
Karaoke booked on the Saturday from 445-645
Yall get to hear my gorgeous voice
Woo
There'd better be recordings
I'll bring my whole recording setup
Lol
Whats the plan for the peeps leaving Seattle for PDX
We drive down friday morning
Ok
How early?
Hotel check in is usually no earlier than 11 so the earliest we should leave is 8am
We should have dinner at the Deschutes brewery one of the nights
Looks like I will very likely be able to make the seattle weekend \o/
Where are the escape rooms we would do?
Woo
There's a ton of them
Ooooh, that sounds fun
I'm pretty intimidated driving in the city if we're actually going into it
Also for pdx I'm hoping I can get picked up on the way
Seattle drivers are ?
Little cat in the big city
We could do that
So are we doing the escape thing in Portland or seattle?
Seattle
I'm thinking we do an escape room at like 3 and head to Round One after that, maybe get a bit to eat after the escape.
maybe we can do some mall shopping prior
on Saturday
What if we don't escape
This is all Sat, right?
then we cry
yeah
Sat is game day
Ooooh, shopping~ I'll call the girls!
but I'm right here
We're going shopping!
yeah :D
We're going shopping in pdx already
oh right
my money
I only have so much
rip money
That's what credit cards are for
They give you free moneys
Am I the girls
Yes
We're all the girls
I need to go shopping
Kona needs more style before he's a girl
Sorry, I'm kinda hogging all of it, aren't I?
Share the style lazor, god
I'm no girl
Now you are
Welcome to the WINX club
The what club
Windows 10 club?
it's some gay ass sailor moon rip off made with Western anime styles
Fox box
That was the best and worst thing as a kid
Sonic X, Ultimate Muscle, that weird anime about the cat girls
A box of foxes? :D
They had digimon :D
Don't all animes have catgirls
Seems like something Japan would do
This was like Sailr Moon cat girls, they were normal girls who would transform into wearing cat girl costumes
And there was an evil older cat girl
Go on
I don't know much more than that, 10 year old me called it gay and changed the channel to YuGiOh
Yet I'd watch Card Captor Sakura without complaint
wasn't that actually good though?
Sakura? I remember it being
I mean I watched the whole first season
Hey would i be able to crash at someone’s place if i have to come in on thursday?
you could crash at my place probably
ok
cant believe its next week already
yeah time is flying
literally
what time would you be flying in?
No idea
Afternoon
You could fly to Seattle if needed too
Ok
Whatever flight gets you here
Kk
I'm going to have a lot of luggage though :<
Good thing @Konagona 's been pumpin' metal
He super buff now
Huh
It's ok kona, no need to hide it
im not swolna
Shh yes you are
id look gross swole lmao
I'm the swolest
I've got huge
Benching 325 now
For real?
Lol no
Still skinny as fuck
The dev I know is a bean pole
Ok good
I really should hit the gym though
What did Jim ever do to you?
Take up parkour with me
I've never had upper body strength until I started doing that
No
Not you kona
I'll just stick to rock climbing
Which I plan on doing tonight
Or eat pickle barrel and get fat
i do need a physical hobby tho
Come snowboarding sometime
Or skiing
that's not something i can do often though :<
and it's $$$$
Yeah it is :(
And snowboarding outfits aren't very cute soooooo
Excuse me
You take that back
Take what back
This
I wouldn't look cute and that's a prerequisite
Well be more kawaii
I like the goggles
Snowboard outfits are more cool than cute
If that's your concern Kona, just go snowboarding in a skirt
this sounds awful
lol hope you don't get cold easily
Wanna test it out for us?
how much money do I get?
cause I need to have something to go along with this
Money?
You're just making sure it's safe for your friends
it's not safe
there
done
But it could be the most fun and sexy activity of your life, you don't know until you try it.
People actually do wear skirts to ski, but they wear them over their ski pants.
and you all scoffed at the idea
To be fair it is pretty hideous
Oh :<
Nevermind then
Nah you just gotta know how to make it look good
Tight rainbow pants
Light colorful ski jacket
Dev are you gonna ski with us someday
Sure
Do you guys have dry or wet powder?
I've never skiied near seattle but I was just at white pass and it was dry.
Dev are you still planning a big Sky trip
We'd both go if you are
Just gotta get myself a pair of skis
i cant anymore
once i turn these apps in i will pretty much not have a life for awhile
rip
Oh?~
I'd die
You could always build a snowman~
huh
Guys, we are going to have to get doner kebabs
My body desires it
Boner kebabs :D
Kebob's Boners
Hustler's new XXX porn parody, "Bob's Boners"
I have one when I eat one
Go ask helix
so what's the plan for this weekend then?
when are you guys driving down? Think you can grab Dev and I or should we come seperately?
We're gonna drive down Friday morning
We can def grab you on the way
Mitch when does your flight get in?
Once we're in Portland we can pick you up whenever
I think I'm picking him up Thursday actually
he's gonna chill with me the night before
Oh ok
That'll work then
What's the name of the karaoke place? Wanna check out their song list
Also willing to pitch in for my group
Voicebox
Is it like closed room karaoke?
Yea
Sweet
Actually flights are good Friday still
So I'll probably try going to Seattle Friday morning, then down to pdx
Oh cool. Easier for me
Are you flying from sea to pdx?
What time will you guys be passing through longview?
Dunno yet
I wanna leave no later than 9
Yeah
So probably 11
Shit I have a test Friday
What time?
A test already?
You could ask to take it early.
You could ask to take it early.
Zieren omg you ready to hang out?
Zieren isn't coming this time sadly
Zie, how does Memorial day weekend look for you?
Aw D:
Ill have to see, i don't know what this semester's schedule is like
But i should be free :D
Isn't there a con that weekend though?
Yes
Furlandia
Furlandia is gonna be tight
Me and Chim have a table there
I think that's the point
NJIT spring semester ends May 11
you're free :D
I like the idea of cabin trip with Zie but our numbers are growing so I'm not sure what we're gonna do about that
Zieren when did you start going back to school?
The cabin is pretty big
true
I say we plan for Zie to come up for con or for cabin
either is fine with me
Same
I'm not a con person ;;
I'll try though :D
Come to the cabin then
well then cabin!
I started going to school again fall 2015
We can go swimming and play spoopy games together
Like explore the creepy woods
Good times
We gotta bring marshmallows next time
Is it a vocab quiz?
Yeah
Yeah just talk to your prof
See if you can take it thurs
What month would the cabin trip be in?
I think it opens back up in april
So anytime past that
Past June I hope. I have classes til mid June
we should go to salem in augus
t
for eclipse timezz
it's only a partial eclipse in SEA and PDX
total in Salem tho
That sounds rad
Oh boy
Come to Salem and experience our lack of fun hip places
Okay not entirely true but the lack of around town activities is limited. It's mostly food and bars, a few cool places but a lot of them close by 7 PM
I think Chim and I are going to be living in Portland before Summer rolls around, depends on if any of our current inquiries come through
The eclipse is at 10am on 8/21 I think
Hey what hotel are we staying at this weekend?
Hilton executive tower I think
Thanks
we still need to book an escape room. How many people are doing that?
Is it 7?
everyone in this chat except Zieren and Dev
Yes, me definitely
I can book the Ninja Escape Hack Attack Mission 1 for $27 each
I like ninjas
They're like human versions of raccoons
lol
It has to be booked in advance. I can go ahead and take care of that if everybody is on board.
I'm on board, I'll vote for @Chimaerarabbit too
Sounds good
What day and time
I'm down
I'm looking at Saturday at 1:30
ok I'm booking it now
you all owe me $27
Thanks for paying for me Rallex, really nice of you.
Isn't he the sweetest most generous guy?
Thanks
Rallex got yur back
I'm no sugar daddy
Your turn now
I had my turn already.
Not with you
But still
Give me sum shugah baybee
You have a girlfriend
Whoa I don't need that salt
Just call me Veruca
huh
Ew
Getting those pre pdx weekend runs in
Which mountain
Red lodge mountain
Watch the weather guys, we're getting snow storm warnings around Salem for Saturday
it's looking like snow on saturday up in Portland too.
Yup, but Oregon forecasts aren't the most accurate
Fingers crossed!
I hope we get snow saturday
I don't, I wouldn't be able to drive up D:
Lol why
It's just snow
I don't have chains ;;
Guess i should buy some
Idk we don't get much snow around here
We get very paranoid about it easily
psh
I drive up to snowboard with my front wheel drive mazda3
I'm driving on basically bald tires
we're so bad with snow lol
Hey what time was everyone looking to get out Sunday?
I have no preference. Shorter trip home for me
Finally in Portland
we're all coming down around noon
And I'll see you tomorrow Dev!
Ok
Actually we're leaving around 1130
Kona has that quiz
We're still picking you two up right?
umm im just going to go to the hotel
Still picking me up
Ok
Don't forget your swimsuits
Not that @Konagona needs a reminder :p
Oh shit I did forget lmao
We have to pass my place on the way to the interstate either way though
Mind if I run in for 2 seconds on the way
That's fine
Kk
I would go now buy I have a bunch of shit factory resetting in front of me rn
actually im going to take pictures of the planes…..if you have room
Take pictures of me
Come to Portland
Last minute Lazor addition
good news is I barely feel sick now
let me know when you guys are almost here
Should be around 11:40
I'm heading to the hotel atm
Pretty nice view
There's a really pretty Japanese garden up in those mountains, next door to the zoo
Hmmmm
Everything is dead though
Sand garden, natural water spouts, koi fish ponds, those uh Japanese houses and huts and stuff
Be a spot for early morning suit pictures
Portland and Salem are sister cities to Japan, we get a lot of Japanese students coming across seas to study
We getting swagot tonight??
Hmm
We could prob do that
how far are you guys?
Tacotime
that tells me nothing!
how close to Longview?
It's time for tacos
Rags you live in the area where Tacotime is shitty
Oh, are they only shitty here?
I thought Tacotime was shitty everywhere
Northwest has like its own weird branch. It's great
I thought Mexican in general was shitty around the NW
but only washington
oh it's not great actual Mexican
Every since Chim took me to TX to have some texmex, my eyes have been opened
texmex is different for sure. I've never had it but I'm curious
My dad would take me to weird places where nobody spoke English
the food was legit
Those are the right places
We got like one place like that in Salem
Get yourself a real Quesadilla, have to eat it with a fork
but yeah, Taco Time here is basically like the burgerville of Mexican fast food
let me know when you guys are getting close
We are a ways away all.
Should I bring any alcohol?
I've got more than I need
Why not.
okie dokie
Guys
Gays
sorry but not sorry….the room is going to smell like curry fried rice
lol
You guys gonna be picking me up soon?
Better
Worse
We will be there in about 20 min
Maybe 25

Here ho
Guys, we are going to a lower floor
really freaken loud construction between 7am to 6pm
are you guys going to be here soon?
Yeah, half hour
Almost there. In downtown Portland
kk
im sitting here
also pool is in the other building this time
Room number?
Huh
i cant escape the stuff ;-;
Damn, be careful @Ragscoon
Use your emergency brake for every corner ^^
ooohhh its only a couple inches, how bad can it be
I'm gonna die
got tread on those tires?
If it's too much for ya, don't risk it
I don't know D:
I'm gonna go buy chains just in case
How much tread do you have on your tires @Ragscoon
I don't know
cause if you have a bit, chains wont do too much more
only if it becomes very packed in and turns to ice
Its going to be a nice wet snow ^^
I know I got my tires changed, about a year ago I think, not much more than that
We've been trying to park for like 10 min
well stop trying and do
Wolf is waiting
Come dev
We require your keycards
tree fiddy
Kona why isn't you hair dyed
because he is lame
Lets get this trip off right
Holy shit the guy working here is hot lmao
Lmao
Telling him
FUCKKKKK
I am happy to report no snow this morning
See you homos in another 5 hours
Ooh, yeah, someone shoot me the hotel address or name when awake please
Hilton
Kona is a bed hog
No he's a shark
Bed shark
Thank you though, going to head out around 11, picking sparkles up from work
We may or may not be here
PDX homo adventure
I was in the middle of kona and Dev
Had both my bitches
PDX ultrahomo adventure
Oh, shoot. I guess uh, just lemme know what the plan is
So I know where to drive/park

Feel free to add sparkles here too
K
undefined
Oh boy it's me

The sparkle cat
Sparkle cat, meet lazor cat
Lazor cat, sparkle cat
two cats in one chat?
Oh shit
THERE CAN BE ONLY OOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEE
Well 4
Cat fight
I'm okay with cats but there can only be one [Noun] Cat
Sorry, sparkles are less dangerous than lazors
And they're prettier, so I gotta side with sparkles
Plus he gives me free art
I'm the best
Except for that $666 YCH I still owe him for
Sparkles tops lazor
owo
voodoo?
Hmm, never had breakfast downtown portland before, Sparkles?
Yeah Voodoo's the only one I can think of, I'd say look for Voodoo 2 though
The first Voodoo is generally always packed
depends on which side of the bridge you are on
We had voodoo last night
We're on the side with Powells
but the magic is in the hole
yeah the other voodoo with shorter lines is on the other side
I can't think of any breakfast only places
You guys got plenty of cafes on that side to choose from lol
try Daily Feast or Brunch Box
or Urban Farmer Portland
this place serves breakfast as well
Yup
You guys'll be fine, you have a huge selection to go from and it's mostly all good
Yeah but I want the best!
While being affordable
If you go to Bijou cafe, you'll be near the river, which means you'll be near the saturday market
Too many options
No Saturday market this time of the year
ooh
yeah too cold
oops
LIAR
kona stop hogging the bed
Arms aren't supposed to do that kona
kona put some pants on
He's in the shower. No pants
GROSS
Oh boy. all this white stuff is coming down. ready to drive up to portland rags?
let's try I guess D:
Wanna head out now? Or sticking around for another hour?
We're heading to breakfast soon
I up for whenever
Okay cool we can head over and pick you up if you're ready
I'm ready. just come to bookbyte
Cool. Heading out now then
kay
Is it snowing in Portland
We're getting breakfast but Virginia is chilling in the room
It's starting to freezing rain
undefined
It's fucking cold
Daily feast was yum
undefined
I keep thinking of the online newspaper
Getting to this bathroom was weird
Where we meeting
You can meet us at the hotel I think
When are you going to be here?
We're getting close
what's the name of the hotel?
Hilton executive tower
Room 1508
Do you guys wanna get coffee?
Almost there
Yea sure
Do you guys want to park and walk or meet there?
Stumptown roasters is the coffee place we are thinking of going
Is it ok to park underground
Yeah?
We gotta find parking
I'd park closer to the hotel tbh
If possible
open the door
What?
Where are we meeting
Where are we supposed to vs
Be
At the coffee place
We're at 1508
Where art though
Damnit
Come to daily feast
Virginia is in there
Someone told me the hotel
Oh nvm
Who the fuck
Well meet you there
At the hotel
Someone gimme some Damn directions that work
We're gonna hang in the lobby
We're on our way
No rush
I need food
Hotel just started some renovations and it's loud in here
We're at peets coffee
Send location?
We're going to the subway around the corner
Rgr
Sparkles were at subway

We are getting grill cheese and tomato soup
We're at rocket Fizz

Okie
We can meet ya there soon. Just finishing up at rocket Fizz
Where're you guys at?
under4men store
Yall still there?
I'm heading out now
Hey can someone send location please
Ok
Set up a skype call with me and put the phone at the end of the table so I can pretend I'm there
My phone is dying
Same
He's living his life
RALLEX NO
Play with me pup
Bark bark
Aren't you guys all in the same room? XD
Gay
Roads were too icy, highway closed off at certain points unless you had chains or traction tires
Oh sit
Shit
Had to pull off south of Portland a little ways, at a motel
Sorry to hear that
We're fine, just exhausted lol
Glad you aren't stranded
Should be cleared up tomorrow, hopefully
D:
Hey guys, I had a really really good time last two days.  If someone covers my fare at checkout I'll PayPal you the money.  In my way to the airport so safe travels back home
It was great meeting you Dev, you're a real class act and I hope to see you again. Safe travels! <3
Thanks
Right now I'm stuck in Las Vegas
x.x
Visit frito and zoey!
They are probably busy, I'll be bouncing between flights basically until midnight
D:
Damn that sucks D:
Now that we're back home and wrapped in blankets I want to say thanks to all of you for letting Chim, Sparkles, and I come hang out ?? We had some serious fun and you're all pretty cool.
Virginia (If you don't mind me using your real name) I hope you get to feeling better D: We can try to make up for the time in Seattle if you're up for it.
Also I totally owe Dev for the car rides last night, hope you're able to get home sooner rather than later, good luck out there.
I'm going the round about way to my dest
Rags didn't even mention me he hates me smh
Oh my gosh Kona haha, I don't hate you
I enjoyed our in-depth football discussions, you're fun. I enjoy having someone else to shitpost in real life with.
Thanks! I hope I'm better by then too. I promise I can actually be fun to hang out with when I'm not so sick.
I thought you were pretty fun regardless, so don't sweat it, I just hope you still had fun in Portland despite illness
Moro, you're pretty cool too, you honestly kind of remind me of the group of high school friends I used to hang out with haha, so I hope you can help show us tourists around Seattle
Ral, you're still a total girl, and I'm glad to have a grrlfriend in you, thanks for introducing me to this bunch
Alright I'm done with the heartfelts
I'd better get one next weekend
yeah what rags said lol, it was a lot of fun getting to hangout with you  guys. I'm looking forward to that Seattle trip
Only if you can make me laugh, otherwise I'm unimpressed
So much pressure ;;
You'll be fine
Rags you're a sweetheart. Glad you guys had a great time. Looking forward to next weekend too!
Don't know when I'll see you next Sparkles, but I look forward to it
Probably when we throw the house warming party for our new place
It's so wet here ;_;
Yeah I'm hype for that
Rags you are adorable
woah wtf
He looks like a porn star
With so many of us going to R1 we should book a bowling lane
I'm down with that
Ooooh, I'll bring my bowling ball
Kona is it possible to reserve a lane?
Ahahahahahhahahahahaha no
Weekend lane waiting time is generally 90-150 minutes
Rip
well if we hang out long enough
Yeah we'll probably be there for several hours either way. The place is huge
Also, I'm a "platinum member" because I spend shitloads of money there, so I'm p sure we all get a discount
They're showing vaginas in the class I wanna vomit
misogynist
gross
I feel 20 times gayer
Are you implying you enjoy the penis cross-section diagrams?
Rude
No :(
The poor penis
What class are you in? XD
Human Sexuality
you took the class, fool!
Kona would rather take male sexuality
Guy next to me in class just said he's never seen an uncircumcised penis???
Is he gay?
I've never seen an uncircumcised penis
I'm assuming no
Wait what
I can understand that. It wasn't until after high school I realized what a circumcision really was, I thought for years it meant they removed the little helmet at the tip
D:
I'm joking :P
undefined
Kona fix the name
I'm not creative atm
undefined
LA? We're in Seattle though
We LA now baby
It's MLK weekend, are you guys doing two days in seattle?
Getting in Friday night, leaving Monday
I think is the plan, but is subject to bring shorter depending on Chim and Rallex, since we're not paying for a motel anymore
If you guys got plans for sunday too I might consider driving back up the next day.
Kitty and I are going skiing Sunday
undefined
It looks like Moro caught the flu I had over the weekend. I hope no one else comes down with it! :c
It's intense but only lasts ~48 hours.
If that's any consolation. .-.
I'm not sick :<
Anyone not use postmates yet
What's that?
I have a code for free delivery on your first order
It's like Uber eats
Oh so it doesn't help me here
But will help this weekend
If we want
If you use it yea
I'm using it cause I'm sick :<
Rest well Alex. That flu looks awful
Tbh I feel much better this morning
I want to go into work but idk
Going to the gym last night might have been pushing it
Don't get other people sick
ok so i'm filling out my passport forms
are my eyes blue or grey
i don't think grey eyes are a thing
it's an option in the dropdown
my license says blue so im going with that
blue
What's the plan for tomorrow?
Chim and me hit the road around noon, after lunch, pick Sky up around 2ish, probably reach Seattle by, what... 6?
Get dindin
Are we doing anything that night?
I'd like to, if you know some fun night joints
Oh uhhhhhhhh
Or just hang out? idk, I think Sky has a better idea of the plan, ask the other coon
oh I don't have a plan. I typically have a problem with overplanning so I've been underplanning a lot recently :P
and we should be there by 6 at the latest
maybe Friday night would be a good night to hit up the gay bar
I'm on board with that
what was the name of the place Sparkles was talking about?
the unicorn?
I think he was talking about a grungier place
unicorn is carnival themed and looks snazzy
I kinda wanna check it out
the only gay bar I've been to is the one in Salem
which was an experience to say the least
and that one's pretty lowkey lol
was a very quiet night for a weekend
it was fine except for that one convo
didn't feel like a gay bar really
ahaha! the cheesy asshole convo?
What Convo lmao
the pony is the grungy gay bar
the bar tender and a couple people at the bar were embarassing me and somehow the convo got vulgar, started saying shit about cheesy assholes
I don't know how it happened, but the bartender said something about eating cheesy asshole
the unicorn is the fancy bar
and Rags saved me from an old man by saying he was dating both Chim and I
all up on the gay hill straight up from the convention center
oh, yeah, they were asking who I was with, cause they were gonna take the straggler
Neighbors is a gay bar with a dance floor we could go to
If yall feel up for dancing
we'll talk about it. I think a gay bar that night for sure though
I'm going to make breakfast Saturday morning
yeah, I'll just have to go soft on the drinks, alcohol + adrenaline don't mix well for me
yeah same here.
Adrenaline from what?
dancing
from dancing, loud music, etc
Heh ok
I'm totally up for dancing, not to say I'm against the idea
Wherever you guys think is fun

Alex i can help you get a new phone today
Is there anything in particular you'd be looking for in one?
S7 or pixel

If it does the S7 edge is a better choice than the S7
We're heading over real soon

I am not gay
the alternative fact
That is not straight
oh bby
That's something I'd wear
you'd wear tighter
Okay true
But the outfit
the stripes
You know me :3
I especially like your stripey outfit that makes you look like you escaped from gay jail
Even the socks were gay jail stripped
yeah you're def too gay to not be locked up
Oh no, don't lock me up~
Death sentence
What no
Off with his head
NO
My class is fucking boring
holy cow
LOL
This reminds me of middle school health class
that's like over half the class
well it's gotta be like 2/3rds at least
ok nvm
still
wtf
how can you not at least have G?
Everyone too embarrassed to answer
isn't it anonymous?
Yeah
BORING
Yes, but damn they embarrassed
Lame-o's
lmao
LOL
That's BS
Missionary was the favorite position of 60%
what class is this?
Holy shit
Intro to human sexuality
Is this Christian health science
No the teacher is hella sex positive
Is this cause Asian family values?
and dumb white people?
well it's because it's an intro class
hey you can give oral to women too
Oooh, they're newbs
I mean I could but I'm gay
true
It is rather nice
Thank you! It IS nice
I have suched a dick
WHO VOTED E
Also I think there's too much of a gap between A and B
My vote would fall between those two
But closer to A
The guy in front of me voted E
damn
I wonder if he's like infertile and that's why he has in interest in sex
Good god you can tell they're all freshmen
For the sex toy question they left my favorite prop out D:
which is?
Oh come on you know >.>
don't think I do
maybe I do
I have a bad memory
Cat ears/tail
that falls under costumes
Oh was that a choice?
So it was
Is a lubricant a sex toy?
I thought that's just a use-as-needed kind of thing
I only believe in procreation
Sex is not for fun
Don't enjoy sex
I like to imagine this guy during sex is just thinking "aww fuck yeah we're gonna create this baby!"
I wonder if he was trolling
Impreg is a legit fetish
I have been shamed
walked in on while fapping
hahaha
who by
my mom :<
did she join
gtfo
Yea Kona they're busy :p
kicking you both

I hope you two learned what powers I have here
Admin abuse!
Woah woah woah
Give me the ability to change the group name and photo back
No give me power
instead
Rallex is hungry for powah
Ok you can all have power again
I'm hungry for many things, but not power
I'm hungry for mama's chunky Campbell soup
ohmy
KONS
KONA
I forgot to send you this
The full theme song
oh god
Neil sampled Wild Wild West
Oooh boy, gonna watch this
the whole album is great
I love Neil's mashups
Oh my god
This is great
I gotta listen to his albums, I only ever watched his videos
my personal fave is Floor Corn atm
Oh my god
Damn that was actually pretty good
This album is amazing
I appreciated the offspring sample
Oh my god, this YMCA/Inception mash up
Neil is a genius at mash ups. check out Mouth Sounds and Mouth Silence too
My favorite new track is Wallspin
Wallspin is good
I'm gonna be upset if these aren't smash mouth mashups
Smash Mouth is in plenty of them
There is an abundance of smash ups
My favorite!
So far I like shit the most but I'm only on song #5
I can't believe I'm listening to these and enjoying them
They're good
A bunch of the tracks are muted due to copyright bs
it's available as a free download tho
Yeah I just linked youtube for a couple individual tracks
I'm so happy he recognizes the greatness of Willennium
Wow wow wickiwicki
Oh my god this mash up of Rollercoaster Of Love and Closer is so catchy
Bustin bustin bustin makes me feel good
We need to have a bad movie night and watch wild wild west
Wow wow wicki wicki
Next time we meet up Kona needs to ride with me again so I can hear Will Smith's Wild Wild West in FLAC again.
I'm only allowed to listen to that song when Kona is playing it for me.
I have the same album
It does not included the titular track, "Wild Wild West"
Seriously?
For that, you'll need Will Smith's 1999 release, Willennium
I also have a copy of Willennium
I thought you decided not to get it because it didn't have the wild wild west rap
Also I have to wonder if the producers wanted to do that rap or if Will Smith was just being really pushy about doing a rap
I can't imagine the producers wanting will anywhere near that movie
I can't imagine WWW without Will
I'm hot cause I'm fly
You ain't cause you not
Oh no...
I haven't seen this since pre-2010
Look at that wide open parking space
What is this? I don't see anything
Oh, right, parking space is rare up there for you guys
Yea
They're less boring than before
I mean, I would say no probably, that's a pretty lousy approach
I would too
Buy me a fucking drink at least
I did already
Horrible way to pick someone up. I'd say no.
depends on the situation for me. probably wouldn't jump straight into bed with them but would be up for hanging out and seeing where it goes
Buy me more
I think if they didn't outright ask to sleep with you than it could be more agreeable
damn I guess I can't just ask you to bed yet
I would say nobody talks like that, but we did try grindr out
oh fuck
that was pretty horrifying
so thirsty
for TITPIG
Oh shit, I live next to titpig
I gotta take a pic when I get home
huh?
One of my neighbors had a really good sticker on his truck
Will show later if I remember
What is random in this case
Just a blind hook up?
yeah these questions are vague
Or just someone you're not dating
like friends with benefits
It gives two fucking definitions
This teacher sucks
I will do friends with benefits but not total randoms
This
Oh then these people are boring
these are freshman
I assume
Mostly yeah
Aww
I had literally 0 desire for rando hook ups cause small town until I met a bunch of furries
being gay here isn't great
I'd say tindr hookups are random hookups
yeah and I wouldn't do that either
I tried tindr for a day and was like
nope
not for me
no shame to those who do
Prob not for your town at least
also yeah that
I try to keep my gay on the dl
I imagine that's difficult lol
Hehe
really I just get gayer around all of you because I'm so comfotable
it's my true self
TIL deleting Linux partitions to reinstall Linux in a dual boot setup makes grub a sad boy
Skylar I didn't know you went to nyc
Broadway, bitch!
Bring me back some pizza
I gotta go see Hamilton
He looks like he's doing the superman
I miss when Soulja Boy would supahman that ho
And then he'd supahsoak that ho
Soulja reminds me of everything wrong with high school
Pretty sure my senior class president danced to that song before winning the lame school election
And then got caught with heroin the next year
I remember dancing to it in hs with friends, it was fun
I got in an argument with some girl because I said soulja couldn't rap
A girl went against him and she gave a great speech detailing her experiences and outlook on the next year. She got Hillarried
He can't lol
Soulja boy was a mistake
I wonder if Purple still has that video of us dancing to it at karaoke
Don't actually watch it
I wasn't going to
Soulja Boi
Soulja boy tell em
Tell em what
I dunno
I've always wondered that
Tell em who the real slim shady is
What?
Who?
Hi!
I'd link Neil Cicierega - Shady Interlude but I can't find it
I played that on repeat for like a half hour at the party I was at this weeke d
That sounds like torture
They're bringing an escape thing to Seattle for one day lmao
What?
realescapegame.com/FFXIV/
Ooooh
FF14 escape room?
Oops wrong link
I can't tell if that was meant to be a joke
I'd go to a ff escape room
me2
oh it's dragon themed
NEVERMIND
lmao
It's themed after the first raid
I didn't play the online final fantasies
I played 14 for a month then stopped
There's cat people tho
Who do you think I played as lol
I played Tera
I had the cutest catboy~
I got to be a little fat red panda
Chim was a little fat bunny
He still is~
I play as a white boy
You are a white boy
Who is the whitest here
Dev
sparkles?
Ok ok first, what is "white" in this context?
no don't overthink it, just answer the question
Me
Dev
you can kinda dance though
Dangit
He is tall mountain man, I give the point to him
I dunno, kona is pretty white too
I'd say it's between the two
Does kona lose our gain white points for liking Asian crap
Hmm
I'd say gain
Oh, Kona is pretty white
Kona is weeaboo white
Dev is rugged white
I am not a weeaboo
Kona doesn't like anime
Just anime boys
Kona is a big weeb animu lord
So we should plan a trip for Vancouver now that kona has a passport
How does the beginning of March look for everyone
I don't know if I'll have my passport by then
Defo by mid-march
OK that works
Mid March is end of the quarter
No can do
When are you getting your passport kona
Impossible
Nothing's impossible if you believe
Uhh
From now?
Mid March I'll be in Toronto
Wrong side of Canada
I'm thinking March 11 weekend
Weekend before finals
Nope
Not to invite myself, but I think Chim and I are going to TFF late March, gonna be strapped for cash
Omg rags ofc you're invited
Yay!
I wouldn't be talking about it in this chat if you weren't all invited
Anyways what about March 25 weekend
Is that tff?
Yup
Stop being so busy people sheesh
Will be in Texas seeing furries and also visiting Chim's family
How about April 1st weekend then
Should work for me I think
Sorry no can do
April fools
Haha, gotya
I'll punch you
Only if I forget to wear green for St. Patricks day
Which is impossible
I always wear green
I don't think you punch people for not wearing green
This is true
Just a pinch
I will still
I punch people when tickled :3
It's my defense mechanism
I kick
Oh
Everyone always punched me :(
And I'd keep yelling "It's not St. Patricks day!" but they wouldn't stop
Poor guy
Awwww
Now I wanna give you a hug
I'll never punch you
Oh
So I should definitely punch you
Wait no
Let's make his dreams a reality!
No! Chiiiim!
It's ok
I'm weak
Cute art btw
Thanks~ :3
I've been so hungry recently
I want so much food
Hungry for dick
Well yeah
That's normal
Do you spread toppings on before eating it
What?  :V
You mean you don't squirt some ketchup on before going to town on the dick?
First off
Mustard is better
Also
No!
Not even a little mayo?
I would agree about mustard if it wasn't the same color as pee
Tbh I don't like ketchup
That sounds like your problem
What does that mean? >:(
Do you also not like chocolate?
Honey dijon is 👌
I love mustard and chocolate!
Just not near genitals!
We'll fix that
Work our way up to butter
NO EW
That's between you and brody
Ewwwwww
Never
I'd rather kona
I didn't know you felt that way about kona
We're not compatible :P
How long have you had these feelings for him
It's true you're both super subby
Since we dabbed together
And that kids is how I met your mother
I'll be kona's daddy
Can't, going home that weekend
Impossible to plan
OK how about the next weekend
That's my birthday
We can take a birthday trip
Not sure when classes start but I can miss an early day
Just shouldn't miss two weekends in a row again
More importantly, when is cabin trip?
It reopens in April so any time after that
It's considerably cheaper too
We could do it in may
Just gotta check when midterms are for everyone
I'll need to get a passport for me and Chim but it would be fun, if he's on board with it
Will discuss after work
If not it sounds like March 25 would work
Not for me
Kitty when are you going to be around for a weekend
You might have to miss the trip if you're that busy
Feb 4th, 18th, March 4th, April 8th and onward
OK April 8 weekend is probably best for Vancouver then
Not to mention grad school visits at some yet to be determined dates
It's expensive and takes forever to receive (unless you pay extra for faster service) so if you're going to do it you need to asap
Thanks for the heads up, will try to get on that but we're strapped at the moment
I need to renew mine too
It's going to expire next month
Getting an enhanced drivers license is a cheaper and faster option. It only allows travel to Canada and Mexico tho
oh, that's fine
Chim you need to get an OR license anyway
And it can't be used for intl air travel including Canada and Mexico
Only for driving to and from
Do it so you have your new one before it expires. It takes 8 weeks by mail or less time if you do it in person
Imma do it in person
You have to pay extra for it
To do it in person?
Yep
Cause its expedited
What
You don't have to expedite it in person
It takes 8 days to process
That's significantly less than like the 30 it takes via mail
They also offer nonexpedited passports though
Seattle passport agency doesnt
yeah it took about a month to recieve mine
and $130
He's renewing, not getting a new one
oh I meant for like Rags and Chim
So fees and processing times are different
Oh :3c
furry
It's so nice out if it wasn't so cold I'd leave work and go for a bike ride
It's cold and windy and it sucks
I can't wait for warm cabin trip
that wood stove <3
Alright so Vancouver trip tentative for April 8 weekend
that's the first weekend after classes start
which should be ok
undefined
where he truly belongs
HA
HA
HAVEN'T HEARD THAT ONE YET
END FURSECUTION
behind the screen miles away
that's where he belongs
I hate computer screens
I'm a computer
stop all the downloadin
I just wanna ride my motahcycle
Don't copy that floppy
Do you all remember what a floppy is
I carry one around with me all the time
I got to destroy some at work
they were ancient
but since they had patient identifiable info, they needed to be destroyed
ew D:
not just thrown away
How'd you destroy them
rip out the magnetic tape
go edward scissorhands on it
technically it could be taped back together
but that is nearly impossible with how many pieces I cut them into
could also burn it
Not to mention I doubt a computer would be able to read it even if it was taped back together
I think if it were like
two simple pieces
then yeah
but seriously
I DESTROYED THEM
in an arts and craftsy sorta way
snip snip
Reminds me of when we would toss expired product when I worked at qfc
We'd throw them against the compactor wall as hard as possible and watch it splatter everywhere
fun
we've got some old backup tapes
I want to take a sledgehammer to them
oh also, for cabin trip, I vote we make it longer
it was too short last time
Heh agreed
As long as everyone can do that
Rags and Chim only live an hour and a half away so they can just come when they want I suppose
Yeah, we're game
plenty of beds
That is a huge plus lol
Just don't total your car on the way like I did
I had to save their asses at like 2 AM
It was a fun adventure
wow what
Alex were there 3 rooms or 4?
I can't remember
And couches in the living room
We could fit like 12 people there
But yeah it was raining heavily at midnight, we were driving along a country road
We rounded a bend and the entire road was littered with rocks up to a foot high
Literally no time to stop so we went right over them
NO
Rip my car
Was ded
The car's starter become a stopper
We sat there for like 3 hours waiting for the tow truck
And several other cars were damaged cause of the rocks
Rocks also caused a 2 or 3 car accident
That was a night
We ended up taking a 4am trip to ihop
Or was it sharis
yeah these guys were lucky my overwatch addiction was pretty strong then
I thought I was sharis
I shouldn't have been awake
Idk bit those crepes were delicious
I got a pie
Hehhe
it was sharis
Ooh yea that pie was good
Coconut creme I think?
That was the weekend my dark souls addiction began
If it's warmer when we go we can go swimming in the lake
Oh man, I do not have a swimming body lol
I decline the swimming. I'll hang with Kona
I'd rather row the boat
we'll see. I'm not much of a swimmer
I'm pretty fucking terrible at it :P
There's a few boats you could take out
A paddle boat, a row boat, and a canoe
I can swim
I would like to ride in the back of a boat
I just don't look very good without a shirt :P
peddling looks to tiring
Aww you don't have to be self conscious about it
I want to canoe around
Are there leeches
Not that I've ever heard of
I hope not. There's gonna be plenty of sucking going on without them!
whoa what kinda trip is this
I mostly mean the straight couple
fucking Kona
Virginia has NO SHAME
This is true
We did, why didn't you
Kona and I spooned a tiny bit
sorry, force of habit
Koona
these new stickers are adorable
thank you :3
the trash can was done by lazor's marshy
that last one cjen just randomly did now
oh I can see this now
huh
Lazor's girlfriend
Marshy
lazor has a gf?
Ye
gay
Trans girl
But still girl
ah ok
As long as it's after school gets out then yep
I think that's sometime in may
Rather i know that's sometime in May, i just don't remember when
Aaaaaaaa
you look so feminine
Yeah I love it
cute
Awww
You're the one in my lap. You're one to talk
You put him in your lap :p
Yeah I didn't have any say so
What!
I asked you
You said yes!
Fucking gay
I can top that in gayness
I got another art
Still a wip
I don't get it
Omg I'm in public
That should hide it
Just headbangin to some sick tunes with your bro, no homo
lol
Who is that even?
But can be be sure you didn't just grab that off Broghan's FA?
a raccoon dude who runs the raccoon chat we're in
Trying to get that moderator position, huh?
Who's that on the couch
a raccoon dude who runs the raccoon chat we're in
Lewd af
I'm thinking may 20 weekend for the cabin
oh, phew, that could work
Weekend before Furlandia
No way for me
I still have class
I had a dream last night @KonaIX was driving my car and kitty and I were riding with him
There's a cat rapper in Portland
I think all of his songs are about cats
Link
these cats are all shaved
the varying production quality of this video is really good
which vid?
telegram browser can suck my dick
it's not letting me paste
Cat King (Official Video)
ty
Purple
is he as good as the crust Punx rappers?
this video is pretty spectacular
I'm the cat king
I'm the cat king
That's why I'm always doing like big cat things
poetry
is that the burnside bridge?
I believe so
ha, see? I played tony hawk :>
Heh I remember that level
burnside was on tony hawk?
I actually went there once when I still boarded
yeah, I think the second one
It was one of the early levels
tony hawk was fun
Chim and Sparkles are both amazing at Tony Hawk
We should watch them play this weekend, it's like otherworldly
a hawk off
Rock out with our Hawks out
I like how MGS2 has a tony hawk minigame
Oh, yeah, that was a demo for an actual skateboarding game Konami made
and we own it too
burnside is on thps1
ah thank you Chim
even more impressive then :3
Thps2 was the best thps imo
I prefer thps4 and the undergrounds, felt like I had way more freedom in those and I was big on trying to hold really long combos
I found a really shitty rom of thps 2 for the gameboy.
oh shit
I had a friend who had that
we played it on the school bus after band class
it's ass
there's also a 007 game for gameboy that's fucking terrible
and if you can find the metal gear game for gameboy too
oooh I played that one
ass
shit
rubbish
I remember it being boring
solid snake's hedge maze adventure
Oh yeah I played thps for the gbc
It was bad
it was another one of those unofficial sequels from the guys who did the fake metal gear 2
are you talking about ghost babel?
That one was official
was there another game?
oh was it?
oops
still not taking it seriously though
the canon never mentions it
it's an alternate reality
and apparently received widespread acclaim according to wikipedia :P
Oh, weird
Maybe I was just too young
Oh God I think I just broke the universe
I'm now converting weight from pounds to volts
Now pounds to Celsius
Convert pounds to USD
I don't think I've implemented that unit
Whattttt
is this about the cat rapper?
The units
Convert cats to coons
wrong
Nope
Cats and coons are equals
That's not how it works
just look at them cuddle though
They can cuddle all they want
We still know we're better than everyone else
Coons are like cats and dogs put together
With a little bit of bear to
Too
I've always thought foxes were cat dog hybrids
cats are just uppity when they got no reason to be
Coons are too docile to be that
have you seen an angry raccoon?
not that docile
they'll kill cats for real
Believe me I'd know
RIP demi
I don't want to be a coon anymore
It's OK that was a while ago
we promise not to eat cats
at least as food
You couldn't eat me if you tried
I wasn't planning to
I'll fight you!
Damn straight
Damn gay
My passport came in already lmao
Nice
lets go to canada today
kk
You know I'm mobbing with the D-R-E
I like good pussy and I like good trees,
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe,
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Well my hard drive I RMA'd seems to be working again
Nvm it's still fucked
People are boycotting amazon for selling trump products
All of my what
People will always boycott for dumb reasons
fuck trump, but this is moronic
i want one : o : o
The powder is real
Ahahaha someone just drove into the truck that carries people from the parking lot to the slope
Wrecked their whole front right bumper
Lolol
People are very good at driving
A burger place is quickly becoming my favorite place for burgers
Happy birthday @Devleon !
Oooooh
Happy birthday Dev :D
Thank you guys
Oh it's Dev day?
Happy birthday Devastator!
Thank you!
Mew~
a kid i went to HS with in the same grade has TWO FUCKING KIDS WHAT THE FUCK
It's happening
Welcome to growing up
One of my classmates was murdered by her husband over winter break
That shocked me
Whoa
It's so pretty out!
here it just looks like gross slush
That's rare
The roads aren't even icy lol
Suburbs tho
Shit
What do I do today now lmao
Fap
Oh my god
Actually do you want to meet at oasis tonight to work on stuff?
I want to submit my job application tonight
Where are you applying to?
Amazon
Big phat phlakes comin down
Free pizza at work today!
It's so empty today
Half the office is gone and production has literally two people on the entire floor
neat
I work in a department that was told that we are all being let go. so pretty much no one is working or has been cut earlier then others
Not grabbing food tonight sorry
That's fine you don't have to
I'm just going to work on stuff
Or do you mean you aren't going regardless
Rip
G
H
A
No baby virginias allowed
such is the life of one with a Vagina
does not apply to me
can't impregnate my butt
Omg "hope/prayer/nothing"
B
b is honestly the best method for pregnancy
Yep, lowest chance of getting preggo besides abstinence ofc.
And I could never be abstinent
H
I don't have sex
I avoid the word coitus
You said it! D:
You said the C-word!
coon
best c word
better than cat
I'll fight you
Northwest Coons vs. Cats
actually this is an incredibly uneven fight
no thanks
meow!
Sparkle could take us both on
I might be able to beat Kona in a fight
maybe
but kona is neither
he's a neutral party
and sparkles/moro both would most definitely knock us both out
I'm staying out of this fight
ok so you ready to take down these cats?
oh damn
I'll stick to stealing the cat food at night
you take Sparkles and Moro
I'll take Lazor and Virginia
Zieren is also kind of a raccoon
he had a coon sona before
WHY DID YOU FAIL TO USE ABSTINENCE
WHAT WENT WRONG WITH ALL YOUR ABSTINENCE TRAINING
that is easily the dumbest question you have shown us yet
well
that sounds like statutory
Being an awkward virgin doesn't count
That's 5 golden stars in guitar hero standards
full combo
activate star power at the proper time for max score
except here it's abstinence power
and the best time is when you are turned on
just shut down that boner
hold the fuck up
there are sects of the furry community that fetishize condoms actually
weird
I mean I guess I prefer that over pregnancy fetishes
usually it's them filling it like a water balloon with their cum
oh nvm
I hate that
I'm no longer a furry as of this moment
mpreg my butt
that's more acceptable than this
let me experience the beauty of childbirth
I want to hold life inside of me for 9 months
the more you fight it, the more bizarre fetishes I'll bring up
So!
Have I brought up the sonic circumcision fetish before?
I'm gonna punch you
Call me Skylar from now on
though honestly I think most of you do irl anyway
I'm barely a furry
Better change your avatar then
My bladder was a contraceptive last night
should've just engaged in some watersports
nty
Eww
pee on virginia
I will kill
pour lush products on virginia
I will glitter
Speaking of lush I need to go shopping this weekend
Oh?
I need new jeans and a new shampoo bar
walking into rainfurrest like
We saw pamperchu at RF
Mother fucker looked like death
Brutal
Damn
That's metal as fuck
explain
The cone is on a metal pole obviously
yeah that's what I assumed
Kona, would you wear this?
JRPG levels of zippers
totes. That's my major complaint with it
I'd feel like a Kingdom Hearts character
Are you looking at TheLees
lol yes
What is the lees
korean clothes
they sell stuff that actually fits me
I buy a lot of jackets and pants from them
glad to see the alice and chains man gets around
Saturday or sunday, doesn't matter to me
I could do Sunday maybe
Saturday I'm really busy
Hby kona could you do sunday
Probably, why the interest all of a sudden lmao
I need new jeans and a shampoo bar
And I have money again
Can't let that continue for too long
Come back when you're a little, mmm, richer
So Chibi Chibi Con is a small anime con on the evergreen campus. Lazor is gonna be there, I'm gonna be there, Lily is gonna be there. You're all invited to join us. Just gonna be a day trip
Evergreen campus?
It's in Olympia
kinda far for you
you're still invited but totally understandable if you don't wanna make the 2 hour trip
Oh 2 hour drive? That's not too bad. Will have to discuss with the bun
could carpool if you decide to join
Yeah, that's not a bad idea
Hmm that could be fun
When is it
oh right, It's this Saturday
Oh, a little short notice, will have to see what Chim says
I'm hype
I'm gonna wear my tail
Furry af
I haven't gotten to wear it since furlandia
it's time
Hmm maybe I will too then
Fuck
Ok, if Chim and I come, count me in the cringefest too
It's only cringey if you make it
lemme get a fedora
I have two tails, I bought a really shitty one from some popular online furry shop like 5 years ago
I'll bring some squeakers then
Hey boys, how do you like my class?~
See now that'd be cringey
Ok no
Alex, don't bring the bells
D: Bells are my favorite...
I'll wear my monster energy drink snapback and sport sunglasses
that's worse than furry
Maybe I'll wear a collar with a bell
Maybe I can finally wear that trench coat
Virginia should come in full cat gear
The cat thing fits in at animecons at least
true
So do tails!!
big poofy ringtail coming through
Ringtails demand attention
yeah I'm an attention whore. So what?
Should I wear my tripp pants too
This is the perfect time to wear trip pants
I'm wearing my leather anime vest for this
Avery cosplay?
Hmm what other furry trash getup do I have to wear...
Who wants to hold my leash?
It's pink
I mean I have my arm warming and ears
Omg
I will if you call me daddy~
I kinda did this...
I know
That's why I said it
Oh, oops
I'm not doing that though D:
Not going to be too gay
It's an anime con, not a furry con
Avery is animated
Furries are animated
With very few frames over a few panels
Look at how animated skylar is at cons
I was gonna say you haven't seen me at my worst
but furlandia was bad
And mff
mff less so
but yeah still bad
Well we can always go to a bar in olympia
eh we'll see
Was your worst the Halloween party?
the halloween party was tame
I mean it was bad
Wasn't fc the worst
supposedly
you'd have to ask @Devleon
I don't know if tame is the right word lol
It wasn't bad, I had good fun
Better than last year
no he meant my drunkeness
Oh...yeah lol
Mff was pretty bad though
I'm just pathetic lol
You're just tiny
Yup
dev should carry me everywhere
Dev's too skinny, he'd snap in half
Oh God it's happening
An amazon recruiter wants to chat
I'm scurred
Brody sent me this
Too gross not to send
Ewwwwwww
I wouldn't wear the shirt
I may be a furry but I'm not proud
You're saying you'd wear the suit though
duh
Ugh this is making me think about how, in freshman year, i looped my school lanyard through my back belt loop so it looked like a tail
Bad, freshman me! >:(
Good
Please tell me you did the naruto run to make it fly behind you too
No, luckily
Also y'all got no furry pride
I got furry pride until the day I mother fucking die
Wow Zieren you're adorable
Respect
This is a proven fact
heeeey everyone
Hiya
I'm super bored. what should I doodle?
RallexXZieren
I approve
got a ref for both?
https://www.dropbox.com/s/5adyx6fvk733bap/RALLEX%203.png?dl=0
here be me
Does Zieren have a ref
I wore a realistic full length cat tail sometimes in middle school
I also wore a fedora sometimes
I also wore a horse mask sometimes
what a dork
Tru
I don't have a traditional ref yet :/
Oh fuck I just got reminded that I wore a collar sometimes
lazor, it's time to hang your head in shame
Shit, too much furry pride, bring it down
Nice
That's exactly how we would kiss
Shh collars are awesome
Also omg I think I just scored an interview with google
Ooooh
Keep us updated
I've been practicing programming whiteboard problems like crazy for the past two weeks now
The hardest part is honestly finding difficult enough questions, the kind that Google or Amazon would ask
But yeah will do
All they really said is that they received my application and will get in touch about the next steps
But that basically means they want to start the interview process
I'm hella nervous about my application
Join the club lol
We meet on weekends to drink
Looooool I love it <3
It's pretty fantastic yea
Congrats dude!
Ty, I gotta brush up on my android skills now
Every time I get a call rn my heart races until it turns out to be some spam call
Omg actually yes
I literally just got that call
That would be such a positive spam call
The snow is still around!
I'd hope so it's only feb
Beautiful!
Oh and the background's nice, too :3
I gotta say those raybans though
It's 50 at 8000ft
I'm dying
They have reception up there?
Nope
Skied my 9 miles and now I'm driving back
Ah
A radish is the blood-red eyeball of god. It is a crimson jewel that grows in the ground and tastes like a salad.
I like radishes
Radishes are a fine addition to a sald
I just eat whole radishes
Dip them in some salt and ranch
mmm
Salt is best way
That's a lot of radish
i just eat them plain
hot radishes are the best
I prefer them shredded with sushi
so many people have given me shit about this, but it's so good
It keeps lookout for "Bonebag", the skeleton spawn of Satan who hath come to push thine eyes closer together.
Please be aware of Bonebag.
Is this from your grammar generator
No. I speak only the purest of truths.
Just saw the ClickHole vid that inspired this
The portland flu happened again. Just spent the past day and a half in bed.
Am I cursed
No, you're sick
Is this the best meme?
I was kinda shocked at what Victoria looked like since all I'd seen of her was that picture
Virginia :P
Vegetable
oh sweet
time for everyone to get new names

Vegeta
Veronica
shit I can't think of anything for me
Barackus
T Rex
Skipper
Scrongus
I like Skipper
You're now Barnalbee
What is lazor's real name again
Uhhhhh
I forgot :P
Answer pls
Braxton
That's it
We could call him
The brother of brexit
Brutger
Dev and lazor are definitely the same person
They could be the brutger brothers
Uhhhhhh what
Dev you have a new brother
Shhh don't worry about it
Just bury your nose in that snow
Hey listen
Hey listen up buddy, these streets are mine, y'hear?
lazor nice ringtail
welcome to the coon side
I'm no maine coon
You can be part coon
That art is nice
I was hoping for clothesless so I would have a body ref
it looks good, very snazzy shades
I'm sure you could ask for no clothes next time
Yea you have to ask for that lol
She does artistic liberty sketches so "finger guns and shades" was pushing it
Her form says no more than a vague theme like "spring or autumn"
Fair enough, just have to find another artist
Ok how the fuck do you stop apps from attenuating the sound of other apps on androis
By putting your phone on vibrate
Huh?
I want both apps to play at full volume
If an app wants others silent, there no override afaik
Oh, that's annoying
I'm so damn tempted to buy this
Oh damn that's cool
Dark souls is 👌
Where is that on the left
Is that the asylum?
And on the right is the painted world?
Yep
And yep
Beautiful
I bought it
neato
Yea it is
Good choice 👌
When yall heading up
We're thinking getting there around noon

Mmm sleep
We're all wearing our furry crap right
I haven't decided what I'm wearing help
Big ol bushy tail
I'll need to brush my tail
Wait why isn't it gifing

I mean tail obviously, I just don't know outfit wise, I got choices
GAY

And put a boulder on top?
I joined kona in his Sex Class for the BDSM panel today. One of the panelists is def furry af.
He's mini uncle kage
I want to see the survey for the BDSM panel
Most of that class is vanilla af
whoops white background

goodbye rags
So true omg.
Amazing, it's like I was there
NO, OPEN THIS LID RIGHT NOW

Ooh there's a dance at the con
it's too late for us
I have to study
In the trash with you
Yeah sorry, we gotta head out after dinner, Chim and I gotta be home by 7
Are you ready to chibi
Oh shit, we're on?
These are my choices of tails :/
Alex should let you wear his red and black tail
What I'm gonna wear that
Is that the only tail you have?
I have two real silver fox tails
But that black/red one is the only furry trash tail I have yea
Omg he almost looks cute
why is he so tiny
to match his hands
but his hands got tinier too!
They shrunk to match him
but then what's the point of getting tiny if he was trying to hide his tiny hands!
OBAMA NO
You're so tall obama-sempai~
How long is everyone staying there tomorrow?
I'll probably be there at 12:30, friend is on his way to my house
Same, traffic is awful
I'll be there at 1
Don't you play with my heart like that dev
We here
Here
Better put my furry shit on
Fuck all of you
Yo where is it?
My ass
We lost
We're in a parking lot
This con is looking pretty furry already
We're in the courtyard
I'm at the gym
Standing outside
Where can I spot ya
We just got here
Get over here
We got a table
Oh my god you guys
Only I'm allowed down there
Holy fuck, this picture is perfect
I actually have tears in my eyes
so edgy
I'm so fucking horny now.
Sparkles is making us drink ghost pepper whiskey help
omg
good luck
RIP Rags and Chim
Fuck I lost
lost how?
We're making a game out of it
Smash brothers, loser takes a half shot, but gets X amount of ghost pepper drops added, X being winning players kill count
you should do roulette
Don't give him ideas!
I'm so cad at this game
a shot of ghost pepper whiskey
with drops of this ghost pepper pure extract
How many dolks going to fyrlandia this year?
Cause were wanting to do like an after party at our place Sunday night of the con since we live in the area
I'm game
That'd be fun
i didn't know you had a restaurant @Rallex
yes pls
Prob some low quality dicks tho
We only hire the best at Rally's
How is it simultaneously 4 for $3 but also free?
the meal is actual dicks
that costs money
but the porn is free
FREE: Photos of your meal
Solitaircia is really goos
Good
Are these questions asked real-time during class?
Damn kona
You better be repping hard in there
Are these mostly freshmen?
I feel like if these people were asked the same questions in a year or two the answers would be more varied
You can only stay straight in college for so long
lol statistics do not agree with these results I'm afraid
Which stats?
that 1 in every 4 friends is gay
in my case, all my friends are gay
huh
you've never heard that before?
Yea I did in highschool
case in point, now you're the gay one
Kk
I'm having trouble with min spanning trees and Dijkstra's
I understand them and can draw them graphically but when it comes to coding them I struggle
man I haven't had to touch those in ages, I mean the trick is writing a recursive method and knowing what the exit clause is, but besides that I can't quite recall
it's vaguely coming back to me
I don't think either of those require recursion
they don't require it, but it helps. or at least that's how I did it
I think
I'm pretty sure they're going to ask me shortest path questions
CS or Discrete Math? Sorry, it's been awhile, so I don't even remember what course I learned those from
CS
I mean there's no difference though
yeah, fairly similar logic studies
wish I could be more hep but I'm half asleep, sorry
Nah it's fine, I just have to keep working at it
How do we create a telegram bot for this chat
I want to make one
ooh, good question
I'm gonna google this, I wanna make a youtube poop bot
You're the worst
I'm going to make a bot and share it with @Ragscoon
What shall we name it
undefined
We can always change the name later
hmmm
How about
demolitiondanbot
Lyric
Lyric?
It'll have red hair :3
Oh I need a permanent username for it that ends with bot
What is the bot going to do?
Anything we want it to do
My first thought was to make it post a random meme from a wrbaite
Using something like /meme
ooh, have it post a random rage comic from r/fuuuuuu
or whatever it's called
Or a random pic from r/cringe
that would be fun and not bad to do, either idea, as long as we decide on a dedicated source for material
Yea
ha yeah, I think r/cringe is mostly videos though
and half of them are boring political videos
We can make it skip videos
Yeah, just saying, I kinda check r/cringe daily, I rarely ever see pics there
tends to be youtube links and self.cringe texts
Anyways
We need a username that ends in bot
I think there is a subreddit for that kinda stuff though, like r/neckbeardthings
hmm
If it was just mine I'd call it djparkourbot
do it, makes me think of parkourdude and deagle nation
Heh ok
what language did you want to use?
What's available?
I'm primarily a C# dev myself, but I'm open to pretty much any language
my only request is no PHP
Java, Python, C#, Ruby, to start
I'd prefer java personally
honestly I think any language that has a web library can be used
son of a bitch
some French assholes already took the name youtubepoopbot
and it doesn't even do anything
Fucking assholes
yeah! fuck them!
How do you know their french?
I bet they wear berets
okay maybe it's spanish but
Frases de Youtube Poops

Nut
I'm so fucking horny now
Calm down sparkles!
We went there this weekend by the way, it's like bike riding distance
but those big red shoes
omg
Such a good selection holy shit
Just, don't think about his chili dog
Robotnik don't inhale!
It's really weird how they decided to add a fart power in Mania
Also the stage where you're a macro sonic destroying green hill zone
Some really weird design choices coming up
I can't wait to see how they incorporate mpreg in the game
If you kill all 5 hidden moles you go to the secret level and play that weird sonic fan dating game
Which one
What happened to the Sega sonic I knew and loved
Aw Sonicman!
I beg your pardon
chili dog
That was the part I was least confused about, but thank you
I need an Eggman buttplug
Mustache included
Oh god
The mustache vibrates
hits the spot
It tickles my fancy
The mustache is a bunch of separate tendrils
Fancy being my prostate
Is this how Robotnik roboticizes the woodland animals?
They haven't done a single survey yet smh
I'm excited to see if they do
Sad numbers
DON'T WISH TO ANSWER
If they didn't want to answer why did they
NA, I DON'T HAVE SEX
SEX IS GROSS SEX IS DUMB I HATE SEX
NA
H) I'll tell you when I finish counting
I hate that surveys H option.
N/A shouldn't be an option
If you have to fake an orgasm you should probably talk to your partner instead of hiding it
Don't put up with bad sex, do something about ut!
Gd the snowflakes down here are massive
renton?
North tukwila
it's not snowing here
Good
I want to be able to get home tonight
smh no one here knows how to handle the snow
Nope
do you lose points if you abstain from surveys?
Yes
but I thought the point was to teach abstinence
No that was WV
