01.12.2016 09:50:57, Purple Kitty: Getting greedy
01.12.2016 12:09:26, Moro(you): So Portland
01.12.2016 12:09:39, Moro(you): We should all spend a weekend there
01.12.2016 12:10:01, Rallex: Agreed
01.12.2016 12:13:19, Moro(you): Dev if you can make it you should reserve the hotel but if not I need to know so I can reserve it
01.12.2016 14:09:02, Devleon: Yes
01.12.2016 14:09:27, Devleon: Ummm I'll have see when I can do it....this is like a really bad time for me
01.12.2016 14:09:38, Devleon: Anything in the next few months
01.12.2016 14:28:07, Moro(you): Weekend of Jan 7th seemed to work best for people. Can you make that
01.12.2016 16:01:02, Devleon: Maybe
05.12.2016 09:16:55, Moro(you): I'm going to just book a hotel for that weekend
05.12.2016 09:17:06, Moro(you): Dev you should come if you can
05.12.2016 09:17:59, Moro(you): It's been too long since I've had voodoo
05.12.2016 11:01:49, Devleon: I'm trying!
05.12.2016 11:01:59, Devleon: Sorry I can't confirm though x.x
05.12.2016 11:02:45, Moro(you): I know, I just want to make sure it happens for the rest of us
05.12.2016 11:03:48, Rallex: I asked Lazor knowing full well that he probably won't. He's still young and just going to Portland with strangers is probably a bit odd
05.12.2016 11:04:14, Moro(you): Who?
05.12.2016 11:04:22, Moro(you): Lazorcat?
05.12.2016 11:04:29, Rallex: yeah
05.12.2016 11:04:29, Moro(you): Don't know him
05.12.2016 11:04:33, Rallex: he lives near Olympia
05.12.2016 11:04:44, Rallex: I'll probably hang out with him sometime myself
05.12.2016 11:04:56, Rallex: we've been talking and I'd consider us friends
05.12.2016 11:05:20, Moro(you): He might feel more inclined to come if you do that before the trip
05.12.2016 11:05:40, Rallex: yeah I'm thinking Furlandia
05.12.2016 11:05:51, Rallex: would be better
05.12.2016 11:14:12, Moro(you): Ok
06.12.2016 04:27:09, Kona: I am back in Seattle

06.12.2016 19:04:38, Purple Kitty: That's what I'd heard. Maybe if it has an x it's int but not all int have an x? Dunno
06.12.2016 19:06:00, Devleon: has to do with the early days of airport and weather stations
06.12.2016 19:06:04, Purple Kitty: Ooooo

12.12.2016 13:01:54, Rags-kun: ok so what exactly is the plan? you guys are getting a room in Portland and just hanging out for the weekend? Or are there particular places you'd like to go?

12.12.2016 13:02:43, Rallex: yeah Kona is underage
12.12.2016 13:02:55, Rallex: I mean we can always kinda split off a bit

12.12.2016 13:03:16, Rags-kun: I remember, but it's not a big deal, there's only a couple bars I know of in Portland anyway really
12.12.2016 13:03:43, Rags-kun: Since I'm usually the driver I don't do much drinking on Portland trips
12.12.2016 13:07:39, Moro(you): We can always go to the barcade
12.12.2016 13:08:14, Rags-kun: oh yeah, would have to be earlier in the day too, before their minor cut off time
12.12.2016 13:08:20, Rags-kun: also before the dudebro crowd shows up
12.12.2016 13:09:42, Kona: I feel like such a shit locking you guys out of half the city :<
12.12.2016 13:10:08, Rags-kun: oh my god kona don't
12.12.2016 13:10:14, Rags-kun: bars aren't that amazing
12.12.2016 13:10:59, Rallex: sometimes you go into a gay bar and then you hear talk of cheesy assholes
12.12.2016 13:11:10, Rags-kun: and you don't want to go to ground kontrol after like 5 PM anyway, it gets packed with frat bros and their girls
12.12.2016 13:11:23, Moro(you): Not in my experience
12.12.2016 13:12:33, Rags-kun: every time I've been to ground kontrol after 5 there's been a line, a bouncer, and frat bros shouting OOOOOOOO and chugging canned beer
12.12.2016 13:13:02, Rags-kun: the same thing kinda happens with Coin Jam here in Salem, we have a smaller barcade here
12.12.2016 13:13:23, Rags-kun: and then when Eugene opened one up while I was living there for school
12.12.2016 13:15:25, Kona: i llike round 1
12.12.2016 13:15:48, Rags-kun: I'd really like to see Round 1, I missed my chance when I was in Seattle last time
12.12.2016 13:15:52, Rags-kun: I hear it's pretty bomb
12.12.2016 13:22:58, Moro(you): I've been listening to porter Robinson all day
12.12.2016 13:23:03, Moro(you): That show was so good
12.12.2016 13:35:28, Rallex: Let's get lazor to join us at round 1
12.12.2016 13:35:45, Kona: when tho
12.12.2016 13:36:00, Kona: today
12.12.2016 13:40:33, Rallex: Sometime next month maybe
12.12.2016 13:40:59, Kyle Wensell: When's furlandia?
12.12.2016 13:41:17, Rags-kun: Memorial day weekend
12.12.2016 13:41:25, Rags-kun: I think
12.12.2016 13:41:51, Rags-kun: I was right
12.12.2016 13:41:51, Rags-kun: May 27-29, 2016
12.12.2016 13:47:20, Rallex: Yep
12.12.2016 13:47:29, Rallex: I'll still have classes sadly
12.12.2016 13:47:41, Rallex: But I'm gonna go
12.12.2016 13:47:51, Rags-kun: And if you guys plan a Seattle thing too let me and Chim know, we might be up for that
12.12.2016 13:47:57, Rags-kun: Haven't been out there since RF '14
12.12.2016 13:48:06, Rallex: Long time
12.12.2016 13:48:36, Rags-kun: It's a 4-5 hour drive for us so we gotta have a good reason to make the journey
12.12.2016 13:59:36, Rallex: yeah totally
12.12.2016 14:00:00, Rallex: what about the weekend after the portland trip
12.12.2016 14:00:07, Rallex: mlk jr day means 3 day weekend :P
12.12.2016 14:00:50, Rallex: although I'm not sure how the lodging situation is now. I'd be willing split on a hotel with you and Chim though
12.12.2016 14:29:42, Rags-kun: That'd be cool, plenty of time to putz around and Chim's on board with it
12.12.2016 14:37:43, Rallex: Double weekend fun :D
12.12.2016 14:42:05, Rags-kun: [[💩 Sticker, size 27'900 bytes]]
12.12.2016 14:45:14, Kona: I'm always here
12.12.2016 14:50:51, Rags-kun: I'm assuming most people here are around or at least closer to Seattle, so I guess Chim and me would be the bigger decision on that one
12.12.2016 16:24:34, Rallex: yeah the rest of them live in the area
12.12.2016 16:24:51, Rallex: kind of a big decision on my part too
12.12.2016 16:25:17, Rallex: missing two weekends in the first few weekends of school
12.12.2016 16:25:19, Rallex: I could fall behind
12.12.2016 16:25:29, Rallex: I'll just not have a social life for the weekdays
12.12.2016 18:37:08, Rallex: Lily might be on board for pdx trip
12.12.2016 18:46:34, Rags-kun: Right, my bad haha, if you're up for it then we are
12.12.2016 18:50:09, Rallex: Well I suggested it :P
12.12.2016 18:50:33, Rallex: But it's only if you guys wanna do it too
12.12.2016 18:55:27, Rags-kun: Of course, we're game
16.12.2016 12:21:47, Moro(you): We doing karaoke saturday
16.12.2016 12:36:23, Moro(you): In portland
17.12.2016 09:26:36, Kona: I have coupons
17.12.2016 09:34:56, Moro(you): How do you use them
17.12.2016 09:35:06, Moro(you): Do I need them when I reserve?
17.12.2016 10:54:04, Kona: I don't think
17.12.2016 10:54:09, Kona: It's just a gift card
18.12.2016 09:11:09, Kona: It's hard being not gay with the fam around :<
18.12.2016 09:36:46, Rags-kun: Just do what I do too not come off gay
18.12.2016 09:38:35, Rags-kun: Use a deep voice, keep your shoulders broad, and don't ever stick your butt out
18.12.2016 09:38:54, Rags-kun: I mean, I think that worked when I was in Texas, nobody said anything so
18.12.2016 09:51:59, Kona: The butt part is hard :<
18.12.2016 09:54:23, Kona: Wait why were you in texas
18.12.2016 09:55:31, Rags-kun: Was meeting Chim for the first time, he lived on the Texas Louisiana border
18.12.2016 09:55:46, Rags-kun: Then we took a road trip from there to Colorado for rmfc
18.12.2016 09:56:09, Kona: Oh fun
18.12.2016 09:56:10, Rags-kun: I almost had my straight disguise down but
18.12.2016 09:57:16, Rags-kun: I couldn't get away from the gay outfits
18.12.2016 09:59:57, Kyle Wensell: Were you discovered? :o
18.12.2016 10:01:40, Kona: I need gay outfits tbh
18.12.2016 10:03:14, Rags-kun: We stopped at a gas station and it was my turn to pay for gas, was going into the convenience store and held the door for these three little kids, one of them walked by and was like "coughgaycough"
18.12.2016 10:04:55, Rags-kun: Ask your mom for her old jeans
18.12.2016 10:05:46, Kona: I don't wear jeans really :<
18.12.2016 10:07:06, Rags-kun: Oh
18.12.2016 10:07:21, Rags-kun: I've got a surplus of skinny jeans, really need some variety...
18.12.2016 10:15:50, Kona: All of the jeans I wear are skinny jeans
18.12.2016 10:15:53, Kona: All 1 pairs
18.12.2016 10:16:41, Kyle Wensell: Did you say to them  "you're not my type"? :V
18.12.2016 10:18:37, Rags-kun: No, they were like 10, I didn't want to get lynched
18.12.2016 10:19:44, Kyle Wensell: Oh, lol
18.12.2016 10:20:27, Kona: Are leggings gay
18.12.2016 10:21:18, Rags-kun: Yes
18.12.2016 10:21:47, Rags-kun: They feel fantastic
18.12.2016 10:21:52, Kona: I love them
18.12.2016 10:22:32, Kona: The real question is shorts on top or no shorts on top
18.12.2016 10:23:59, Kona: Shorts clash but hide the dick
18.12.2016 10:25:32, Kyle Wensell: Skirt
18.12.2016 10:28:14, Rags-kun: Skirt
18.12.2016 10:28:39, Rags-kun: Shorts can work with leggings dude, you just need the right pair
18.12.2016 10:28:52, Rags-kun: Color coordinate it
18.12.2016 10:29:34, Kyle Wensell: You have to find those tight kinds of shorts with the legs rolled up a little
18.12.2016 10:31:17, Rags-kun: Yeah, that's what I use
18.12.2016 10:31:54, Rags-kun: I'll take older skinny jeans I have and cut the legs off to turn them into shorts, roll them up a little to hide the fray
18.12.2016 10:32:08, Rags-kun: And if you have fabric glue to keep it rolled up then perfect
18.12.2016 10:54:32, Kona: I should get a skirt
18.12.2016 10:56:12, Rags-kun: yeah! :3
18.12.2016 10:56:39, Rags-kun: just be careful about the tighter business looking skirts, on guys they make the bulge much more apparent lol
18.12.2016 10:58:13, Kona: We should go shopping in Portland tbh
18.12.2016 10:59:40, Rags-kun: Absolutely, Portland has some cool stores
18.12.2016 11:04:07, Kona: I need gay shit
18.12.2016 11:16:08, Kona: Like
18.12.2016 11:16:17, Kona: I wanna be gayer in general tbh
18.12.2016 11:16:20, Kona: It's a problem
18.12.2016 11:18:43, Rags-kun: I do most of my shopping on Amazon, can be hit or miss
18.12.2016 11:19:48, Kona: Yeah
18.12.2016 11:21:22, Rags-kun: Sparkles prob knows of some good clothing shops around Portland, I'm asking him if he wants to come
18.12.2016 11:21:29, Rags-kun: He's the one with the pink mohawk
18.12.2016 11:22:02, Kona: I don't remember what anyone from Portland looks like. :<
18.12.2016 11:23:08, Kona: Lemme see a photo
18.12.2016 11:26:09, Rags-kun: [[Photo]]
18.12.2016 11:26:14, Rags-kun: He's the middle
18.12.2016 11:26:34, Rags-kun: Only pic I could find that didn't have something over his face
18.12.2016 11:46:13, Kona: I remember the ear things
18.12.2016 11:57:17, Kona: The gauges
18.12.2016 12:04:52, Kyle Wensell: He looks like an entire ska-punk band in one person
18.12.2016 12:05:25, Kyle Wensell: In a good way though
18.12.2016 12:05:44, Rags-kun: When you meet him you'll continue to think so
18.12.2016 12:06:01, Rags-kun: It's the spirit of Portland really
18.12.2016 12:39:50, Kona: I'm hype for this trip
18.12.2016 12:40:29, Moro(you): Speaking of which I need to call the karaoke place
18.12.2016 12:40:52, Kona: I wanna be really gay during it
18.12.2016 12:42:13, Kona: During this trip home all the gay is being stuck inside
18.12.2016 21:31:43, Rallex: A friend and I just did an awesome escape room thing. Same store is in the vancouver mall. Anybody interested in doing a team based puzzle escape adventure during our portland trip? :D
18.12.2016 21:32:51, Moro(you): I'd be down
18.12.2016 21:33:59, Rallex: Gonna do another one tomorrow. One I did here was a 20 minute challenge. We beat it with not hints with 3 and a half minutes remaining. The ones in Vancouver are an hour long
18.12.2016 21:34:58, Kyle Wensell: Wrong chat rags ><
18.12.2016 21:39:23, Kona: huh
18.12.2016 21:40:40, Rags-kun: ?
18.12.2016 21:40:43, Rallex: yeah I think Chim aand I might be up to it, I'll ask him
18.12.2016 21:40:43, Rallex: @Chimaerarabbit hey dude you up to it?
18.12.2016 21:40:47, Rallex: this?
18.12.2016 21:40:55, Rags-kun: I was talking about PAX
18.12.2016 21:41:07, Rallex: well
18.12.2016 21:41:10, Chim Aera: what is this thing that I'm up to
18.12.2016 21:41:15, Rallex: no good
18.12.2016 21:41:23, Chim Aera: uhoh
18.12.2016 21:42:45, Rags-kun: uh, I guess PAX is in Seattle, it's a gaming con, which is one thing Iwas gonna ask you about
18.12.2016 21:42:53, Rags-kun: the other was that puzzle room thing I told you about during dinner
18.12.2016 21:43:16, Kona: PAX is the best
18.12.2016 21:43:20, Kona: i work there lmao
18.12.2016 21:43:26, Rallex: Portland - Jan 6-8

18.12.2016 21:43:42, Rallex: these are fun events we have talked about :P
18.12.2016 21:43:43, Kona: PAX's 2017 date is not public
18.12.2016 21:43:56, Rallex: hence the ???
18.12.2016 21:44:12, Kona: (it's labor day weekend, but I didn't tell you that)
18.12.2016 21:44:24, Chim Aera: I'm up for anything
18.12.2016 21:44:41, Rallex: ~
18.12.2016 21:45:02, Rags-kun: yeah, for the Portland thing, my crew lives just like 40 minutes from Portland, so we're along for the ride, we're down for what the rest of you want to do
18.12.2016 21:45:11, Rags-kun: and we can show off some neat places we know of if warranted
18.12.2016 21:45:37, Rallex: yeah Portland I think you guys should come up for Saturday at the very least
18.12.2016 21:46:07, Rags-kun: that's the plan, maybe Sunday too if there's more going on? but we're not staying the night
18.12.2016 21:46:31, Rallex: escape room game is $120 total so the more the merrier
18.12.2016 22:13:04, Rags-kun: how many people can be in one room?
18.12.2016 22:19:38, Rags-kun: escape room I mean
18.12.2016 22:22:33, Kyle Wensell: Oooh okay
18.12.2016 23:56:14, Rallex: It says 4-8 recommended
19.12.2016 00:27:19, Kyle Wensell: That's the trick to escape rooms:
19.12.2016 00:27:35, Kyle Wensell: You have to smuggle a ninth person in via backpack
19.12.2016 00:41:13, Rallex: Me!
19.12.2016 21:42:02, Rallex: undefined
19.12.2016 21:42:22, Rallex: Lazor is prob gonna join us in Seattle the weekend after Portland
19.12.2016 21:55:49, Lazorcat: Woah I'm in a new group
19.12.2016 21:56:12, Devleon: WELCOME TO THIS DOMAIN, SPEAK YOUR NAME AND WHAT YOU WILL
19.12.2016 21:56:38, Lazorcat: Hi, I'm Lazorcat and I just want love.
19.12.2016 21:56:51, Devleon: well i wont hurt you ;p
19.12.2016 21:57:24, Lazorcat: I like the group icon
19.12.2016 21:58:02, Moro(you): He might nibble a bit though
19.12.2016 22:06:43, Rallex: Lazor is my son and I will protect him from you heathens
19.12.2016 22:07:06, Devleon: id like to see you try
19.12.2016 22:10:03, Rallex: I will shield him with my body
19.12.2016 22:10:17, Devleon: Ill just pick you up and move you out of the way
19.12.2016 22:10:33, Rallex: I hope you're ready to see a grown man flail and cry
19.12.2016 22:12:27, Devleon: Ill just hold you out.....not like you'd be able to hit me lol
19.12.2016 22:16:55, Rallex: I can spit
19.12.2016 22:17:07, Devleon: I can toss
19.12.2016 22:17:36, Rallex: Dang
19.12.2016 22:17:47, Rallex: Well I'll still protect lazor
19.12.2016 22:17:53, Rallex: Somehow
19.12.2016 22:19:59, Devleon: Lazor, do you accept me
19.12.2016 22:21:01, Rallex: Dev is tall and cannot be trusted
19.12.2016 22:21:14, Devleon: im the BFG
19.12.2016 22:21:24, Lazorcat: You'll need to fill out this 30 page psychological evaluation alongside a cursory physical exam before I make my decision
19.12.2016 22:21:27, Rallex: Big friendly gay
19.12.2016 22:21:39, Devleon: basically
19.12.2016 22:59:55, Rags-kun: Does lazor need a room? He can crash with us if need be
19.12.2016 23:04:15, Rags-kun: Unless he also lives near Seattle, which I think is the case
19.12.2016 23:06:24, Lazorcat: It's a hour drive to Seattle but there's no way I would be able to stay overnight on this trip
19.12.2016 23:06:41, Lazorcat: That's the reason I can't make the Portland trip
19.12.2016 23:08:23, Rags-kun: Aah alright then
19.12.2016 23:09:01, Rags-kun: Either way it'll be awesome to meet, hope to see you there
20.12.2016 08:08:08, Rallex: yeah Lazor is a youngun, it's understandable that he should have some limits
20.12.2016 08:08:30, Rallex: I mean the youngest guy in the room besides him would be me and I'm a whole 6 years older
20.12.2016 08:12:47, Rallex: Also, Lazor, everyone here is in the northwest except Zieren. I just love Zieren so I wanna find an excuse to get him to hang out with us. Perhaps PAX
20.12.2016 08:14:41, Rallex: perhaps cabin trip
20.12.2016 08:14:46, Rallex: so much to do!
20.12.2016 08:24:35, Kyle Wensell: so much to see!
20.12.2016 08:28:19, Rags-kun: So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
20.12.2016 08:28:26, Rags-kun: You'll never know if you don't go
20.12.2016 08:28:35, Kona: I'm not dead lmao
20.12.2016 08:28:44, Rags-kun: You'll never shine if you don't glow
20.12.2016 08:30:31, Rallex: I assumed you weren't going to stay in the room with Rags, Chim, and I in Seattle
20.12.2016 08:30:48, Kona: Oh probably not
20.12.2016 08:31:05, Rallex: yeah I assumed Seattle peeps would wanna save their money
20.12.2016 08:31:05, Kona: I'll stay in already paid for land
20.12.2016 09:46:24, Lazorcat: My goal is to be able to stay in a room with people for Furlandia, hopefully that will happen if I meet up with you guys in "safer" circumstances enough times.
20.12.2016 09:46:46, Rallex: yep, we'll see how things go
20.12.2016 11:14:22, Purple Kitty: When are you going to seattle?
20.12.2016 11:18:38, Rallex: the weekend right after :P
20.12.2016 11:19:07, Purple Kitty: Two weekends of this chat. :D
20.12.2016 11:19:28, Devleon: fc is the next weekend though D:
20.12.2016 11:19:40, Rallex: yeah and I can't go to that
20.12.2016 11:56:19, Devleon: So do we fly out sunday?
20.12.2016 11:56:36, Devleon: for the pdx weekend?

23.12.2016 08:55:12, Devleon: what weekend?
23.12.2016 08:55:13, Lazorcat: I think I love puzzle break because that name is hilariously generic
23.12.2016 08:55:16, Rallex: approximately
23.12.2016 08:55:32, Kona: Locurio wouldn't hire my ass
23.12.2016 08:55:40, Rallex: lol
23.12.2016 08:56:40, Rallex: Locurio sounds like they've got one amazing room
23.12.2016 08:56:43, Rallex: and then not much else
23.12.2016 08:56:54, Rallex: they have an outdoor puzzle but that sounds hella confusing
23.12.2016 08:56:55, Rallex: and cold
23.12.2016 08:57:32, Kona: They have a room but as part of the hiring process I already know all the answers
23.12.2016 08:57:57, Rallex: oh
23.12.2016 08:58:03, Rallex: well then not doing that
23.12.2016 08:58:36, Rallex: There's a groupon for Ninja Escape mission 1
23.12.2016 08:58:44, Rallex: $180 to reserve the whole room
23.12.2016 08:59:01, Rallex: we'd be saving money if more than 7 went
23.12.2016 08:59:05, Rallex: more than 6 I mean
23.12.2016 08:59:09, Devleon: is this for the portland trip or seattle?
23.12.2016 08:59:16, Rallex: seattle
23.12.2016 08:59:30, Lazorcat: If I'm not staying in Seattle with you guys you gotta send me an itinerary with what you're planning so I know when I gotta drive up.
23.12.2016 08:59:35, Devleon: portland we pretty much just drinking and eating gay donuts?
23.12.2016 08:59:36, Rallex: ah shit somebody is missing out if I only do one!
23.12.2016 08:59:53, Rallex: you know I'm gonna deep throat a dick donut

23.12.2016 09:01:35, Devleon: chilling would be more than cool with me
23.12.2016 09:01:41, Rallex: alright
23.12.2016 09:01:46, Rallex: that solves that
23.12.2016 09:02:17, Rallex: who's in for the escape room in Seattle? 7 in this chat will be there
23.12.2016 09:02:17, Devleon: traveling to san fran after pdx
23.12.2016 09:02:49, Lazorcat: The country must feel very small to you Dev
23.12.2016 09:03:11, Devleon: seattle to jfk is still 6hrs x.x
23.12.2016 09:03:37, Devleon: but yeah kinda
23.12.2016 09:04:22, Kona: It's 7 for SEA-PIT
23.12.2016 09:04:24, Kona: I hate it
23.12.2016 09:04:58, Lazorcat: I won't like spending money on both Round 1 and an escape room but I guess I'll do it if I can be there
23.12.2016 09:05:51, Rallex: It's gonna be an expensive few weeks for me
23.12.2016 09:05:57, Moro(you): I can't wait to hear dev sing at karaoke
23.12.2016 09:07:08, Rallex: We should have a game day. Meet up at Round 1 and hang out there before heading to an escape room
23.12.2016 09:07:30, Rallex: maybe come back for bowling
23.12.2016 09:07:35, Moro(you): Sat or sun?
23.12.2016 09:08:00, Lazorcat: I'll probably just come up for that day then.
23.12.2016 09:08:10, Rallex: I'm up for either. any other Seattle plans?
23.12.2016 09:08:19, Moro(you): Snowboarding for me
23.12.2016 09:08:35, Moro(you): But I can do that either day
23.12.2016 09:10:27, Rallex: @Ragscoon @Chimaerarabbit did you guys wanna hit up some of the more touristy areas? Pike's and the Seattle Center?
23.12.2016 09:10:53, Kona: It's better to do R1 later
23.12.2016 09:11:04, Kona: Goddamnit Skylar
23.12.2016 09:11:24, Rags-kun: Count us in, we barely know the Seattle area lol
23.12.2016 09:11:26, Rallex: You don't have to come to those :P
23.12.2016 09:11:51, Kona: No you just never spell it right lmao
23.12.2016 09:12:03, Rallex: oh right
23.12.2016 09:12:07, Rallex: I always forget
23.12.2016 09:12:07, Kona: Pike Place is the road it's on
23.12.2016 09:12:16, Kona: Therefore the noun is not possessive
23.12.2016 09:12:44, Rallex: Now I'll just say it to piss you off
23.12.2016 09:12:47, Rallex: It's the new pep
23.12.2016 09:13:02, Kona: I don't know why it pisses me off so easily but it does lmao
23.12.2016 09:13:18, Rallex: can't wait to buy some pep at Pike's
23.12.2016 09:16:07, Lazorcat: Let's have a Olympia weekend instead, we can do fun stuff like... Give money to homeless people... And... Go to tiny art exhibits.
23.12.2016 09:17:04, Kona: I'm excited for round 1

23.12.2016 09:19:07, Lazorcat: Nope, haven't heard of it before Rallex suggested it.
23.12.2016 09:19:20, Moro(you): It's pretty awesome tbh
23.12.2016 09:19:25, Rallex: so we gotta play the table flip game

23.12.2016 09:22:13, Devleon: Nope nope nope
23.12.2016 09:22:23, Devleon: I can't sing and you don't want to hear it
23.12.2016 09:22:26, Rallex: get him drunk
23.12.2016 09:22:36, Devleon: I won't even drunk
23.12.2016 09:22:52, Rallex: I'll get drunk enough for the both of us
23.12.2016 09:23:16, Rags-kun: That's not hard for you to do
23.12.2016 09:33:38, Rallex: shush
23.12.2016 09:34:12, Rags-kun: split his fill with me so we're not having to carry you everywhere :P

27.12.2016 14:45:03, Kona: Ok
27.12.2016 14:45:10, Kona: How early?
27.12.2016 14:47:37, Moro(you): Hotel check in is usually no earlier than 11 so the earliest we should leave is 8am
27.12.2016 14:50:37, Moro(you): We should have dinner at the Deschutes brewery one of the nights
27.12.2016 14:53:11, Lazorcat: Looks like I will very likely be able to make the seattle weekend \o/
27.12.2016 14:53:19, Lazorcat: Where are the escape rooms we would do?

27.12.2016 14:54:24, Rallex: Also for pdx I'm hoping I can get picked up on the way
27.12.2016 14:54:27, Moro(you): Seattle drivers are 👍
27.12.2016 14:54:44, Lazorcat: Little cat in the big city
27.12.2016 14:55:05, Moro(you): We could do that
27.12.2016 14:55:57, Moro(you): So are we doing the escape thing in Portland or seattle?
27.12.2016 14:58:05, Rallex: Seattle
27.12.2016 15:01:08, Rallex: I'm thinking we do an escape room at like 3 and head to Round One after that, maybe get a bit to eat after the escape.
27.12.2016 15:01:17, Rallex: maybe we can do some mall shopping prior
27.12.2016 15:01:21, Rallex: on Saturday

27.12.2016 16:02:18, Rallex: Kona needs more style before he's a girl
27.12.2016 16:02:44, Lazorcat: Sorry, I'm kinda hogging all of it, aren't I?
27.12.2016 16:12:10, Rags-kun: Share the style lazor, god

27.12.2016 16:22:05, Rallex: Fox box
27.12.2016 16:22:24, Rags-kun: That was the best and worst thing as a kid
27.12.2016 16:22:39, Rags-kun: Sonic X, Ultimate Muscle, that weird anime about the cat girls

27.12.2016 16:23:20, Moro(you): Don't all animes have catgirls
27.12.2016 16:23:31, Moro(you): Seems like something Japan would do
27.12.2016 16:24:03, Rags-kun: This was like Sailr Moon cat girls, they were normal girls who would transform into wearing cat girl costumes
27.12.2016 16:24:08, Rags-kun: And there was an evil older cat girl
27.12.2016 16:35:08, Moro(you): Go on

27.12.2016 16:38:25, Rags-kun: Yet I'd watch Card Captor Sakura without complaint

03.01.2017 18:38:21, Rags-kun: Okay not entirely true but the lack of around town activities is limited. It's mostly food and bars, a few cool places but a lot of them close by 7 PM
03.01.2017 18:39:25, Rags-kun: I think Chim and I are going to be living in Portland before Summer rolls around, depends on if any of our current inquiries come through

08.01.2017 13:11:02, Rags-kun: I thought you were pretty fun regardless, so don't sweat it, I just hope you still had fun in Portland despite illness
08.01.2017 13:12:30, Rags-kun: Moro, you're pretty cool too, you honestly kind of remind me of the group of high school friends I used to hang out with haha, so I hope you can help show us tourists around Seattle

09.01.2017 13:27:09, Moro(you): Kona is it possible to reserve a lane?
09.01.2017 13:29:39, Kona: Ahahahahahhahahahahaha no
09.01.2017 13:30:00, Kona: Weekend lane waiting time is generally 90-150 minutes

09.01.2017 13:30:14, Rallex: well if we hang out long enough

09.01.2017 13:31:16, Kona: Also, I'm a "platinum member" because I spend shitloads of money there, so I'm p sure we all get a discount

09.01.2017 15:29:10, Rallex: you took the class, fool!
09.01.2017 15:31:13, Moro(you): Kona would rather take male sexuality
09.01.2017 16:02:28, Kona: Guy next to me in class just said he's never seen an uncircumcised penis???
09.01.2017 16:02:53, Rags-kun: Is he gay?
09.01.2017 16:03:34, Rallex: I've never seen an uncircumcised penis
09.01.2017 16:03:50, Kona: I'm assuming no
09.01.2017 16:03:53, Kona: Wait what
09.01.2017 16:03:57, Rags-kun: I can understand that. It wasn't until after high school I realized what a circumcision really was, I thought for years it meant they removed the little helmet at the tip

10.01.2017 13:59:49, Rags-kun: Getting in Friday night, leaving Monday
10.01.2017 14:00:21, Rags-kun: I think is the plan, but is subject to bring shorter depending on Chim and Rallex, since we're not paying for a motel anymore
10.01.2017 14:11:43, Lazorcat: If you guys got plans for sunday too I might consider driving back up the next day.
10.01.2017 14:15:32, Moro(you): Kitty and I are going skiing Sunday

11.01.2017 20:24:45, Moro(you): i don't think grey eyes are a thing
11.01.2017 20:25:25, Kona: it's an option in the dropdown
11.01.2017 20:26:57, Kona: my license says blue so im going with that
11.01.2017 20:27:05, Rallex: blue
12.01.2017 09:16:01, Kona: What's the plan for tomorrow?
12.01.2017 09:21:40, Rags-kun: Chim and me hit the road around noon, after lunch, pick Sky up around 2ish, probably reach Seattle by, what... 6?
12.01.2017 09:21:42, Rags-kun: 7?
12.01.2017 09:21:53, Rags-kun: Get dindin

12.01.2017 09:23:22, Kona: (I just go to the arcade most weekends)
12.01.2017 09:58:08, Rallex: oh I don't have a plan. I typically have a problem with overplanning so I've been underplanning a lot recently :P
12.01.2017 09:58:20, Rallex: and we should be there by 6 at the latest
12.01.2017 09:58:53, Rallex: maybe Friday night would be a good night to hit up the gay bar
12.01.2017 09:59:16, Rags-kun: I'm on board with that
12.01.2017 10:00:05, Rallex: what was the name of the place Sparkles was talking about?
12.01.2017 10:00:12, Rags-kun: the unicorn?
12.01.2017 10:01:12, Rallex: I think he was talking about a grungier place
12.01.2017 10:01:20, Rallex: unicorn is carnival themed and looks snazzy
12.01.2017 10:01:24, Rallex: I kinda wanna check it out
12.01.2017 10:01:32, Rallex: the only gay bar I've been to is the one in Salem
12.01.2017 10:01:43, Rallex: which was an experience to say the least
12.01.2017 10:02:03, Rags-kun: and that one's pretty lowkey lol

12.01.2017 10:04:14, Rags-kun: the bar tender and a couple people at the bar were embarassing me and somehow the convo got vulgar, started saying shit about cheesy assholes
12.01.2017 10:04:19, Rallex: I don't know how it happened, but the bartender said something about eating cheesy asshole
12.01.2017 10:04:28, Sparkle Cat: the unicorn is the fancy bar
12.01.2017 10:04:43, Rallex: and Rags saved me from an old man by saying he was dating both Chim and I

26.01.2017 02:27:32, Rallex: Seriously?
26.01.2017 02:27:47, Rallex: (Music inspired by)
26.01.2017 02:27:48, Kona: For that, you'll need Will Smith's 1999 release, Willennium
26.01.2017 02:28:15, Kona: I also have a copy of Willennium
26.01.2017 07:10:19, Rags-kun: I thought you decided not to get it because it didn't have the wild wild west rap
26.01.2017 07:11:03, Rags-kun: Also I have to wonder if the producers wanted to do that rap or if Will Smith was just being really pushy about doing a rap
26.01.2017 07:22:38, Moro(you): I can't imagine the producers wanting will anywhere near that movie
26.01.2017 07:25:33, Rags-kun: I can't imagine WWW without Will

30.01.2017 14:37:49, Purple Kitty: Horrible way to pick someone up. I'd say no.
30.01.2017 14:39:48, Sparkle Cat: depends on the situation for me. probably wouldn't jump straight into bed with them but would be up for hanging out and seeing where it goes
30.01.2017 14:39:49, Rags-kun: Buy me more
30.01.2017 14:41:09, Rallex: I think if they didn't outright ask to sleep with you than it could be more agreeable
30.01.2017 14:41:28, Rallex: damn I guess I can't just ask you to bed yet
30.01.2017 14:41:59, Rags-kun: I would say nobody talks like that, but we did try grindr out

01.02.2017 13:41:44, Rags-kun: Which is impossible
01.02.2017 13:41:47, Rags-kun: I always wear green
01.02.2017 13:43:07, Moro(you): I don't think you punch people for not wearing green
01.02.2017 13:43:07, Rallex: This is true
01.02.2017 13:43:14, Moro(you): Just a pinch
01.02.2017 13:43:16, Rallex: I will still
01.02.2017 13:43:39, Moro(you): I punch people when tickled :3
01.02.2017 13:43:51, Moro(you): It's my defense mechanism
01.02.2017 13:44:32, Rallex: I kick
01.02.2017 13:45:01, Rags-kun: Oh

01.02.2017 13:45:26, Rags-kun: And I'd keep yelling "It's not St. Patricks day!" but they wouldn't stop
01.02.2017 13:45:51, Rags-kun: (Please don't believe this)
01.02.2017 13:46:00, Moro(you): Poor guy

01.02.2017 13:46:25, Rags-kun: >:(
01.02.2017 13:46:27, Rallex: I'll never punch you
01.02.2017 13:46:44, Rags-kun: (You're doing the exact opposite)
01.02.2017 13:46:51, Rags-kun: (That never happened)
01.02.2017 13:47:01, Rallex: Oh
01.02.2017 13:47:07, Rallex: So I should definitely punch you
01.02.2017 13:47:22, Rags-kun: Wait no

01.02.2017 14:06:47, Rallex: I've been so hungry recently
01.02.2017 14:07:07, Rallex: I want so much food
01.02.2017 14:07:10, Moro(you): Hungry for dick
01.02.2017 14:07:16, Rallex: Well yeah
01.02.2017 14:07:20, Rallex: That's normal
01.02.2017 14:08:04, Moro(you): Do you spread toppings on before eating it
01.02.2017 14:08:17, Rallex: What?  :V
01.02.2017 14:08:52, Moro(you): You mean you don't squirt some ketchup on before going to town on the dick?
01.02.2017 14:09:03, Rallex: First off
01.02.2017 14:09:09, Rallex: Mustard is better
01.02.2017 14:09:13, Rallex: Also
01.02.2017 14:09:16, Rallex: No!
01.02.2017 14:09:26, Moro(you): Not even a little mayo?
01.02.2017 14:09:29, Rags-kun: I would agree about mustard if it wasn't the same color as pee
01.02.2017 14:09:43, Moro(you): Tbh I don't like ketchup
01.02.2017 14:09:49, Rallex: That sounds like your problem
01.02.2017 14:10:02, Rags-kun: What does that mean? >:(
01.02.2017 14:10:13, Rallex: Do you also not like chocolate?
01.02.2017 14:10:17, Moro(you): Honey dijon is 👌
01.02.2017 14:10:52, Rags-kun: I love mustard and chocolate!
01.02.2017 14:10:57, Rags-kun: Just not near genitals!
01.02.2017 14:11:07, Rallex: We'll fix that
01.02.2017 14:11:20, Rallex: Work our way up to butter
01.02.2017 14:11:29, Rags-kun: NO EW
01.02.2017 14:11:52, Moro(you): That's between you and brody
01.02.2017 14:12:43, Rallex: Ewwwwww
01.02.2017 14:12:45, Rallex: Never
01.02.2017 14:14:03, Rallex: I'd rather kona
01.02.2017 14:14:22, Moro(you): I didn't know you felt that way about kona
01.02.2017 14:14:36, Rallex: We're not compatible :P
01.02.2017 14:14:40, Moro(you): How long have you had these feelings for him
01.02.2017 14:14:53, Moro(you): It's true you're both super subby
01.02.2017 14:14:55, Rallex: Since we dabbed together
01.02.2017 14:15:34, Moro(you): And that kids is how I met your mother
01.02.2017 14:15:56, Rallex: I'll be kona's daddy
01.02.2017 14:22:31, Purple Kitty: Can't, going home that weekend
01.02.2017 14:22:53, Rallex: Impossible to plan
01.02.2017 14:23:43, Moro(you): OK how about the next weekend
01.02.2017 14:23:49, Moro(you): That's my birthday
01.02.2017 14:24:00, Moro(you): We can take a birthday trip
01.02.2017 14:24:41, Rallex: Not sure when classes start but I can miss an early day
01.02.2017 14:24:56, Rallex: Just shouldn't miss two weekends in a row again
01.02.2017 14:25:16, Rallex: More importantly, when is cabin trip?
01.02.2017 14:25:43, Moro(you): It reopens in April so any time after that
01.02.2017 14:26:03, Moro(you): It's considerably cheaper too
01.02.2017 14:26:11, Moro(you): We could do it in may
01.02.2017 14:26:30, Moro(you): Just gotta check when midterms are for everyone
01.02.2017 14:30:50, Rags-kun: I'll need to get a passport for me and Chim but it would be fun, if he's on board with it
01.02.2017 14:30:56, Rags-kun: Will discuss after work
01.02.2017 14:31:28, Moro(you): If not it sounds like March 25 would work
01.02.2017 14:31:33, Purple Kitty: Not for me
01.02.2017 14:31:48, Moro(you): Kitty when are you going to be around for a weekend
01.02.2017 14:32:05, Moro(you): You might have to miss the trip if you're that busy
01.02.2017 14:46:03, Moro(you): @Zieren said he wanted to come out for the cabin trip right
01.02.2017 14:46:43, Purple Kitty: Feb 4th, 18th, March 4th, April 8th and onward
01.02.2017 14:47:32, Moro(you): OK April 8 weekend is probably best for Vancouver then
01.02.2017 14:47:51, Purple Kitty: Not to mention grad school visits at some yet to be determined dates
01.02.2017 14:49:16, Purple Kitty: It's expensive and takes forever to receive (unless you pay extra for faster service) so if you're going to do it you need to asap
01.02.2017 14:51:30, Rags-kun: Thanks for the heads up, will try to get on that but we're strapped at the moment
01.02.2017 14:52:37, Moro(you): I need to renew mine too
01.02.2017 14:52:46, Moro(you): It's going to expire next month
01.02.2017 14:53:20, Purple Kitty: Getting an enhanced drivers license is a cheaper and faster option. It only allows travel to Canada and Mexico tho
01.02.2017 14:53:56, Rags-kun: oh, that's fine
01.02.2017 14:54:09, Rags-kun: Chim you need to get an OR license anyway
01.02.2017 14:54:25, Purple Kitty: And it can't be used for intl air travel including Canada and Mexico
01.02.2017 14:54:37, Purple Kitty: Only for driving to and from
01.02.2017 14:57:18, Purple Kitty: Do it so you have your new one before it expires. It takes 8 weeks by mail or less time if you do it in person
01.02.2017 14:58:09, Moro(you): Imma do it in person
01.02.2017 14:59:23, Purple Kitty: You have to pay extra for it
01.02.2017 14:59:34, Moro(you): To do it in person?
01.02.2017 14:59:41, Purple Kitty: Yep
01.02.2017 14:59:46, Purple Kitty: Cause its expedited
01.02.2017 14:59:49, Moro(you): What
01.02.2017 15:00:08, Moro(you): You don't have to expedite it in person
01.02.2017 15:00:19, Purple Kitty: It takes 8 days to process
01.02.2017 15:00:39, Purple Kitty: That's significantly less than like the 30 it takes via mail
01.02.2017 15:00:58, Moro(you): They also offer nonexpedited passports though
01.02.2017 15:01:15, Purple Kitty: Seattle passport agency doesnt
01.02.2017 15:02:13, Rallex: yeah it took about a month to recieve mine
01.02.2017 15:02:24, Rallex: and $130
01.02.2017 15:02:37, Purple Kitty: He's renewing, not getting a new one
01.02.2017 15:02:54, Rallex: oh I meant for like Rags and Chim
01.02.2017 15:02:56, Purple Kitty: So fees and processing times are different
01.02.2017 15:03:00, Purple Kitty: Oh :3c
01.02.2017 15:03:12, Rallex: furry
01.02.2017 15:07:00, Moro(you): It's so nice out if it wasn't so cold I'd leave work and go for a bike ride
01.02.2017 15:09:26, Rallex: It's cold and windy and it sucks
01.02.2017 15:09:39, Rallex: I can't wait for warm cabin trip
01.02.2017 15:10:03, Moro(you): that wood stove <3
01.02.2017 15:12:28, Moro(you): Alright so Vancouver trip tentative for April 8 weekend
01.02.2017 15:14:58, Rallex: that's the first weekend after classes start
01.02.2017 15:15:01, Rallex: which should be ok
01.02.2017 15:17:17, Moro(you): undefined

01.02.2017 15:20:07, Rallex: behind the screen miles away
01.02.2017 15:20:10, Rallex: that's where he belongs
01.02.2017 15:20:22, Rags-kun: I hate computer screens
01.02.2017 15:20:38, Rallex: I'm a computer
01.02.2017 15:20:40, Rallex: stop all the downloadin
01.02.2017 15:22:51, Rags-kun: I just wanna ride my motahcycle
01.02.2017 15:23:15, Moro(you): Don't copy that floppy
01.02.2017 15:23:57, Moro(you): Do you all remember what a floppy is
01.02.2017 15:28:51, Rags-kun: I carry one around with me all the time
01.02.2017 15:29:26, Rallex: I got to destroy some at work
01.02.2017 15:29:30, Rallex: they were ancient
01.02.2017 15:29:43, Rallex: but since they had patient identifiable info, they needed to be destroyed
01.02.2017 15:29:43, Rags-kun: ew D:
01.02.2017 15:29:49, Rallex: not just thrown away
01.02.2017 15:30:04, Moro(you): How'd you destroy them
01.02.2017 15:30:13, Rallex: rip out the magnetic tape
01.02.2017 15:30:18, Rallex: go edward scissorhands on it
01.02.2017 15:30:26, Rallex: technically it could be taped back together
01.02.2017 15:30:44, Rallex: but that is nearly impossible with how many pieces I cut them into
01.02.2017 15:30:53, Rallex: could also burn it
01.02.2017 15:31:49, Moro(you): Not to mention I doubt a computer would be able to read it even if it was taped back together
01.02.2017 15:32:13, Rallex: I think if it were like
01.02.2017 15:32:16, Rallex: two simple pieces
01.02.2017 15:32:20, Rallex: then yeah
01.02.2017 15:32:27, Rallex: but seriously
01.02.2017 15:32:32, Rallex: I DESTROYED THEM
01.02.2017 15:32:45, Rallex: in an arts and craftsy sorta way
01.02.2017 15:32:49, Rallex: snip snip
01.02.2017 15:35:13, Moro(you): Reminds me of when we would toss expired product when I worked at qfc
01.02.2017 15:35:45, Moro(you): We'd throw them against the compactor wall as hard as possible and watch it splatter everywhere
01.02.2017 15:35:52, Rallex: fun
01.02.2017 15:36:00, Rallex: we've got some old backup tapes
01.02.2017 15:36:07, Rallex: I want to take a sledgehammer to them
01.02.2017 15:36:37, Rallex: oh also, for cabin trip, I vote we make it longer
01.02.2017 15:36:41, Rallex: it was too short last time
01.02.2017 15:37:10, Moro(you): Heh agreed
01.02.2017 15:37:17, Moro(you): As long as everyone can do that
01.02.2017 15:43:29, Rallex: Rags and Chim only live an hour and a half away so they can just come when they want I suppose
01.02.2017 15:45:11, Rags-kun: Yeah, we're game
01.02.2017 15:45:29, Rallex: plenty of beds
01.02.2017 15:45:36, Rags-kun: That is a huge plus lol
01.02.2017 15:45:59, Purple Kitty: Just don't total your car on the way like I did
01.02.2017 15:46:12, Rallex: I had to save their asses at like 2 AM

01.02.2017 15:48:16, Moro(you): And couches in the living room
01.02.2017 15:48:27, Moro(you): We could fit like 12 people there
01.02.2017 15:50:46, Moro(you): But yeah it was raining heavily at midnight, we were driving along a country road
01.02.2017 15:51:17, Moro(you): We rounded a bend and the entire road was littered with rocks up to a foot high
01.02.2017 15:51:36, Moro(you): Literally no time to stop so we went right over them
01.02.2017 15:51:51, Rags-kun: NO

01.02.2017 15:52:58, Purple Kitty: And several other cars were damaged cause of the rocks
01.02.2017 15:53:03, Moro(you): "It'll be there in an hour" -three hours ago
01.02.2017 15:53:13, Purple Kitty: Rocks also caused a 2 or 3 car accident
01.02.2017 15:53:19, Purple Kitty: That was a night
01.02.2017 15:53:32, Moro(you): We ended up taking a 4am trip to ihop

01.02.2017 15:55:42, Moro(you): If it's warmer when we go we can go swimming in the lake
01.02.2017 15:55:59, Rags-kun: Oh man, I do not have a swimming body lol
01.02.2017 15:56:16, Rallex: I decline the swimming. I'll hang with Kona
01.02.2017 15:56:26, Rags-kun: I'd rather row the boat
01.02.2017 15:56:32, Rallex: we'll see. I'm not much of a swimmer
01.02.2017 15:56:38, Rallex: I'm pretty fucking terrible at it :P
01.02.2017 15:56:57, Moro(you): There's a few boats you could take out
01.02.2017 15:57:12, Moro(you): A paddle boat, a row boat, and a canoe

06.02.2017 12:40:27, Moro(you): It's so empty today
06.02.2017 12:40:50, Moro(you): Half the office is gone and production has literally two people on the entire floor
06.02.2017 12:44:58, Sparkle Cat: neat
06.02.2017 12:45:33, Sparkle Cat: I work in a department that was told that we are all being let go. so pretty much no one is working or has been cut earlier then others
06.02.2017 16:13:54, Moro(you): @KonaIX Purple I'm thinking kona and I are going to meet at oasis to get some work done but after that we should go build a snowman or something
06.02.2017 16:52:54, Kona: Not grabbing food tonight sorry

08.02.2017 14:46:44, Purple Kitty: B
08.02.2017 14:47:46, Rallex: b is honestly the best method for pregnancy
08.02.2017 14:48:32, Purple Kitty: Yep, lowest chance of getting preggo besides abstinence ofc.
08.02.2017 14:48:53, Purple Kitty: And I could never be abstinent
08.02.2017 14:49:06, Purple Kitty: :3c
08.02.2017 14:49:21, Rags-kun: H
08.02.2017 14:49:24, Rags-kun: I don't have sex

08.02.2017 14:55:36, Rallex: best c word
08.02.2017 14:55:40, Rallex: better than cat
08.02.2017 15:03:35, Purple Kitty: I'll fight you
08.02.2017 15:04:10, Rallex: Northwest Coons vs. Cats
08.02.2017 15:04:20, Rallex: actually this is an incredibly uneven fight
08.02.2017 15:04:22, Rallex: no thanks
08.02.2017 15:04:22, Sparkle Cat: meow!
08.02.2017 15:04:31, Rallex: Sparkle could take us both on
08.02.2017 15:06:05, Rallex: I might be able to beat Kona in a fight
08.02.2017 15:06:07, Rallex: maybe
08.02.2017 15:07:13, Rags-kun: but kona is neither
08.02.2017 15:07:17, Rags-kun: he's a neutral party
08.02.2017 15:07:58, Rags-kun: and sparkles/moro both would most definitely knock us both out
08.02.2017 15:08:02, Rags-kun: I'm staying out of this fight
08.02.2017 15:08:02, Rallex: ok so you ready to take down these cats?
08.02.2017 15:08:06, Rallex: oh damn
08.02.2017 15:08:12, Rags-kun: I'll stick to stealing the cat food at night
08.02.2017 15:08:13, Rallex: you take Sparkles and Moro
08.02.2017 15:08:22, Rallex: I'll take Lazor and Virginia
08.02.2017 15:08:50, Rallex: Zieren is also kind of a raccoon
08.02.2017 15:08:57, Rallex: he had a coon sona before

08.02.2017 15:10:45, Rags-kun: WHY DID YOU FAIL TO USE ABSTINENCE
08.02.2017 15:10:59, Rags-kun: WHAT WENT WRONG WITH ALL YOUR ABSTINENCE TRAINING
08.02.2017 15:11:16, Rags-kun: that is easily the dumbest question you have shown us yet
08.02.2017 15:11:35, Kona: [[Photo]]
08.02.2017 15:11:44, Rallex: "partner forced"
08.02.2017 15:11:46, Rallex: well
08.02.2017 15:11:48, Rags-kun: "I intended to use abstinence, but I couldn't activate it in time"
08.02.2017 15:11:57, Rallex: that sounds like statutory
08.02.2017 15:12:26, Rags-kun: "Always succeeded being abstinent"
08.02.2017 15:12:35, Rags-kun: Being an awkward virgin doesn't count
08.02.2017 15:13:29, Rags-kun: "I have a 100% track record of performing abstinence"
08.02.2017 15:13:38, Rags-kun: That's 5 golden stars in guitar hero standards
08.02.2017 15:13:47, Rallex: full combo
08.02.2017 15:13:55, Rags-kun: 1200 note streak
08.02.2017 15:13:58, Rallex: activate star power at the proper time for max score
08.02.2017 15:14:09, Rags-kun: except here it's abstinence power
08.02.2017 15:14:21, Rallex: and the best time is when you are turned on
08.02.2017 15:14:26, Kona: [[Photo]]
08.02.2017 15:14:28, Rallex: just shut down that boner
08.02.2017 15:14:41, Rallex: "fun/sexy to use"
08.02.2017 15:14:48, Rallex: hold the fuck up
08.02.2017 15:15:16, Rags-kun: there are sects of the furry community that fetishize condoms actually
08.02.2017 15:15:26, Rallex: weird
08.02.2017 15:15:43, Rallex: I mean I guess I prefer that over pregnancy fetishes
08.02.2017 15:15:43, Rags-kun: usually it's them filling it like a water balloon with their cum
08.02.2017 15:15:51, Rallex: oh nvm
08.02.2017 15:15:53, Rallex: I hate that
08.02.2017 15:16:01, Rallex: I'm no longer a furry as of this moment
08.02.2017 15:16:07, Rags-kun: *splat* GOT YA
08.02.2017 15:20:50, Rallex: mpreg my butt
08.02.2017 15:20:55, Rallex: that's more acceptable than this
08.02.2017 15:21:13, Rallex: let me experience the beauty of childbirth
08.02.2017 15:21:25, Rallex: I want to hold life inside of me for 9 months
08.02.2017 15:21:32, Rags-kun: the more you fight it, the more bizarre fetishes I'll bring up
08.02.2017 15:25:02, Rags-kun: So!
08.02.2017 15:25:19, Rags-kun: Have I brought up the sonic circumcision fetish before?

17.02.2017 17:37:50, Moro(you): I have two real silver fox tails
17.02.2017 17:38:17, Moro(you): But that black/red one is the only furry trash tail I have yea

17.02.2017 18:40:29, Rallex: to match his hands
17.02.2017 18:41:20, Rags-kun: but his hands got tinier too!
17.02.2017 18:43:21, Moro(you): They shrunk to match him
17.02.2017 18:43:44, Rags-kun: but then what's the point of getting tiny if he was trying to hide his tiny hands!

22.02.2017 15:00:46, Kyle Wensell: You better be repping hard in there
22.02.2017 15:07:09, Moro(you): Are these mostly freshmen?
22.02.2017 15:07:48, Moro(you): I feel like if these people were asked the same questions in a year or two the answers would be more varied
22.02.2017 15:08:20, Moro(you): You can only stay straight in college for so long
22.02.2017 15:39:19, Rags-kun: lol statistics do not agree with these results I'm afraid
22.02.2017 15:39:54, Moro(you): Which stats?
22.02.2017 15:40:17, Rags-kun: that 1 in every 4 friends is gay
22.02.2017 15:40:27, Rags-kun: in my case, all my friends are gay
22.02.2017 15:40:56, Moro(you): huh
22.02.2017 15:41:49, Rags-kun: you've never heard that before?
22.02.2017 15:42:18, Moro(you): Yea I did in highschool
22.02.2017 15:42:47, Rags-kun: case in point, now you're the gay one
22.02.2017 15:42:55, Moro(you): Kk
22.02.2017 15:43:47, Moro(you): I'm having trouble with min spanning trees and Dijkstra's
22.02.2017 15:44:15, Moro(you): I understand them and can draw them graphically but when it comes to coding them I struggle
22.02.2017 15:45:16, Rags-kun: man I haven't had to touch those in ages, I mean the trick is writing a recursive method and knowing what the exit clause is, but besides that I can't quite recall
22.02.2017 15:45:20, Rags-kun: it's vaguely coming back to me
22.02.2017 15:45:38, Moro(you): I don't think either of those require recursion
22.02.2017 15:46:02, Rags-kun: they don't require it, but it helps. or at least that's how I did it
22.02.2017 15:46:37, Rags-kun: I think
22.02.2017 15:47:50, Moro(you): I'm pretty sure they're going to ask me shortest path questions
22.02.2017 15:48:39, Rags-kun: CS or Discrete Math? Sorry, it's been awhile, so I don't even remember what course I learned those from
22.02.2017 15:48:48, Moro(you): CS
22.02.2017 15:49:05, Moro(you): I mean there's no difference though
22.02.2017 15:49:46, Rags-kun: yeah, fairly similar logic studies
22.02.2017 15:49:55, Rags-kun: wish I could be more hep but I'm half asleep, sorry
22.02.2017 15:50:46, Moro(you): Nah it's fine, I just have to keep working at it
22.02.2017 15:51:40, Moro(you): How do we create a telegram bot for this chat
22.02.2017 15:51:45, Moro(you): I want to make one
22.02.2017 15:52:54, Rags-kun: ooh, good question

22.02.2017 15:55:58, Moro(you): What shall we name it
22.02.2017 15:56:38, Moro(you): undefined
22.02.2017 15:56:57, Moro(you): We can always change the name later
22.02.2017 15:57:12, Rags-kun: hmmm

22.02.2017 15:57:59, Moro(you): It'll have red hair :3
22.02.2017 15:59:14, Moro(you): Oh I need a permanent username for it that ends with bot
22.02.2017 16:00:42, Rags-kun: What is the bot going to do?
22.02.2017 16:01:01, Moro(you): Anything we want it to do
22.02.2017 16:01:31, Moro(you): My first thought was to make it post a random meme from a wrbaite
22.02.2017 16:01:40, Moro(you): Using something like /meme
22.02.2017 16:02:23, Rags-kun: ooh, have it post a random rage comic from r/fuuuuuu
22.02.2017 16:02:27, Rags-kun: or whatever it's called
22.02.2017 16:02:57, Moro(you): Or a random pic from r/cringe
22.02.2017 16:02:58, Rags-kun: that would be fun and not bad to do, either idea, as long as we decide on a dedicated source for material
22.02.2017 16:03:04, Moro(you): Yea
22.02.2017 16:03:14, Rags-kun: ha yeah, I think r/cringe is mostly videos though
22.02.2017 16:03:27, Rags-kun: and half of them are boring political videos
22.02.2017 16:03:43, Moro(you): We can make it skip videos
22.02.2017 16:05:29, Rags-kun: Yeah, just saying, I kinda check r/cringe daily, I rarely ever see pics there
22.02.2017 16:05:35, Rags-kun: tends to be youtube links and self.cringe texts
22.02.2017 16:05:47, Moro(you): Anyways
22.02.2017 16:05:57, Moro(you): We need a username that ends in bot
22.02.2017 16:06:00, Rags-kun: I think there is a subreddit for that kinda stuff though, like r/neckbeardthings
22.02.2017 16:06:03, Rags-kun: hmm
22.02.2017 16:06:43, Moro(you): If it was just mine I'd call it djparkourbot
22.02.2017 16:07:32, Rags-kun: do it, makes me think of parkourdude and deagle nation
22.02.2017 16:07:44, Moro(you): Heh ok
22.02.2017 16:10:02, Rags-kun: what language did you want to use?

22.02.2017 16:10:18, Rags-kun: I'm primarily a C# dev myself, but I'm open to pretty much any language
22.02.2017 16:10:22, Rags-kun: my only request is no PHP
22.02.2017 16:10:44, Rags-kun: Java, Python, C#, Ruby, to start

22.02.2017 16:11:06, Moro(you): I'd prefer java personally

23.02.2017 14:35:08, Rags-kun: son of a bitch
